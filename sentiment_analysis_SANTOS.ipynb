       "[\"One of the best romance movies I have ever seen and one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen. I loved the book and I loved the movie even more. The writing, plot, story, and screenplay were fantastic. Shaileen Woodley and Ansel Elgort's performances in the film as Hazel and Augustus were spectacular. The Fault in Our Stars is gorgeous, funny and sad at the same time and it shows true love can be found no matter what. Loved it so much.\",\n",
       " 'I went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing anything more than the overall plot. I am a sucker for a good love story, especially love that I can relate to. The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real, as if I was feeling the same emotions.\\n\\nThough this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen, it was also one of the most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is. \\n\\nI probably cried throughout about half of the movie, along with the rest of the audience. I cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues I came in with. Again, the actors really expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that. \\n\\nI am going to see it again for sure.\\n\\nGO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES!',\n",
       " \"'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film is true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds another dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story.\",\n",
       " \"Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.\\n\\nElgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they're acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I've seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley's torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two's sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that's because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don't even think there's a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent.\\n\\nAs far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained.\",\n",

The story is completely credible, it can happen any time to anyone.\\n\\nIt is an Ode for Life, it tell us that \"We can and should have moments of infinite joy within a limited time\" It is our choice!\\n\\nI liked very much this film!',\n",
       " \"Before I continue with this review, please note that I have not read the book, but am going to in the very near future :) Please note that Im also a (straight) guy... not that it matters :P\\n\\nWow what can I say about this movie. From the moment the title sequence starts, I was hooked straight away. Scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing. Honestly, this is the best movie I have seen all year, even better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Godzilla which was a massive surprise. I just thought this was going to be another teenie love story and boy was I wrong. I loved this movie and recommend it to everyone across all ages. I'm rambling on and praising the movie now so I should probably get on with the review.\\n\\nThe direction and cinematography was fantastic. Not a single shot felt odd or out of place. Every shot matched the scene and felt real. The editing was also great as shot after shot matched with the characters faces and where they were (typical good movie editing stuff). \\n\\nThe acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie. Seriously it makes the two characters feel real and alive, and at times I forgot this was fiction and not based on a true story. Their performances were so heartfelt and definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion. But knowing the academy this is just another teenie love story that will not be acknowledged at all. Hopefully I'm wrong, but thats the way it normally is. \\n\\nThis is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
       " 'This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes. Including the closing credits, that you need to dry your eyes and think about what you just saw. It\\'s the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of life; because their \\x84eternity\" has an expiration date, set by Hazels terminal illness: Cancer. \\n\\nAs the viewer is put on an emotional roller-coaster, alongside the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share, this movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds. And through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions.\\n\\nThe writing and directing is so brilliantly executed, that you have sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to (short) life. Even when they oppose another you feel unable to take sides. Because you find yourself sharing both. And when the credits role - like the tears on your cheek - you realize, that these opposing views are one and the same after all: Life.',\n",
       " 'Wow. Being an avid book reader, I\\'m always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don\\'t be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It was an absolute success. I\\'d give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I don\\'t believe in \"perfect.\"',\n",

I brought a box of tissues and I used about half of them. I have never cried so much in my entire life. Being an avid fan of the book, I was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books, the movie would be ruined. But no, the movie had all of the book's materials in it (except for one thing). I never thought Shailene and Ansel would play Hazel and Gus, but when I watched it, their performance blew me away. I think Shailene's ability to cry got ME crying, because that's how real it felt. It is an amazing movie, and I'm sorry to say that it's even better than A Walk to Remember. Go see this movie, and if you do, maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared!\",\n",

That's why I give it a 9 not a 10! Now the reason I'm writing this review, this movie is sad. It promises to be sad just by the decription and the trailer. Looking at the cover tells you that it's going to be romantic. If you do not like these types of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave this heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0, do not watch this movie. My fiancé put it right, this movie (and book) is The Notebook on steroids! You will cry.You will get mad at the crying because it won't stop. And above all you will watch it again and again thinking each time you'll make it without a single tear. That will not happen but you'll try anyway.

       " 'Imagining a day without love has become impossible since I watched this movie. No matter which kind of love we focus on, what really matters is this that an antidote to all poisons and a key for all doors has been summarized into 4 words; LOVE.\\n\\nIt was a year ago when I started reading John Green\\'s novel, \"The Fault In Our Stars\". I found out from the first pages that at least one guy could finally find a new way to anecdote a romance story and do believe in this fact that this guy could make a revolution in this genre. Actually, as a person who usually writes about different subjects, I had never ever thought about this kind of relationship. A relationship between two teenagers whom both suffer from cancer and in a way are strange. Not only the idea of this story is something pure but also the words which writer\\'s used to communicate better with readers are among the best ones. anyway, accept my apology because we are here not for the book\\'s review but because of the movie\\'s one.\\n\\nLike all the reviews I have here on IMDb, screenplay is the first item in which I\\'m interested to talk to you about it. As you know when you want to make a movie out of a successful novel or story which has acclaimed critical praises without any pictures, you have a hard job to do not only because of this fact that you are not able to change everything you want but also because of this fact that maybe changing words affects reader\\'s mind. Here the writers could\\'ve done their job in its best way. Just follow these four simple steps and then you will find out why I\\'m telling you this. 1-Open The Book 2-Read It 3-Watch The Movie 4-Review The Book , and you feel that you\\'ve seen all the things you expected without any deficiencies. That\\'s exactly the reason I know this title as an important movie. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have done their best.\\n\\nAbout the casts, I searched, but couldn\\'t find anyone better than Shailene Woodley as Hazel and Ansel Elgort as Gus. We\\'ve seen them before in the Divergent but here they show how good they are. Two things would be enough to prove their abilities; The way Ansel Elgort tries to communicate with all audiences and his co star by his body language and without any dialogue and sometimes just by staring into Hazel\\'s eyes which shows that he has overwhelmed by his role and his character and the way Hazel tries to convince you she is in love with Gus. So, they\\'ve done their job perfectly. Actually, I\\'ve become one of their fans since I watched this movie and their amazing collaboration with each other.\\n\\nAs a conclusion, I prefer to write about the best scene of the movie, based on my own opinion. I think the scene that Gus asked Hazel to write him a funeral speech and asked her to read it in front of him, while he was alive and was there in his own funeral ceremony, was the best scene. The way they became sad, the way they became happy by reviewing their memories and etc. all together would be enough to convince you how memorable this scene is.\\n\\nI think if you are interested in romance movies you should watch this movie. Believe me! it\\'s a good one. \\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nAmin Ghanbari',\n",

       " 'It is nearly impossible to make a film about terminal illness and not make it heartfelt. The Fault in Our Stars has its heart in the right place but – WOW! – you walk out wishing that someone would shake the dust and clutter and broken fragments off the screenplay so it can flow with more efficiency. Here is a movie that is so busy being profound that the characters feel trapped by plot gimmicks and stale dialogue.\\n\\nBased on the bestselling book by John Greene, the movie stars the talented Shailene Woodly as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager with Stage 4 thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs. She\\'s been living with this disease since she was 13, and now she lugs around an oxygen tank with a nasal cannula. Hazel is distant, a bit surly and more than a little bit cynical about the world. In other words, she\\'s a normal teenager. Her parents force her to attend a cancer survivor support group that is led by an overly emotional group leader who begins each session by unrolling a large rug with a big – and somewhat unnerving – picture of Jesus on it.\\n\\nOne day in group she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a fellow teen who confidently announces that he is suffering from osteosarcoma which has already claimed the lower part of his right leg. He\\'s a nice guy that Hazel meet-cutes when she bumps into him in the hallway. There is little resistance from either side as to how they feel about one another and in the blink of an eye, they fall in love.\\n\\nThat\\'s more or less all that you need to know. The connection between Hazel and Augustus is not really built on chemistry but on the fact that they both suffer from terminal illness. The movie doesn\\'t have the flow of real life, but is built on conventions of the plot. Everything in their relationship is calculated for effect, we get gimmicks instead of narrative. For example, Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: \"They don\\'t kill you unless you light them. And I\\'ve never lit one. It\\'s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don\\'t give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor.\" That\\'s fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say \"STOP THAT!!\" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. There is an odd subplot about a book that Hazel has read over and over by a mysterious author named Peter Van Haughton who has apparently disappeared into seclusion somewhere in Amsterdam. After a long and pointless series of arguments with doctors and with Hazel\\'s parent, she and Augustus accept an invitation to fly to Amsterdam to meet him. Van Haughton is played in an angry performance by Willem DeFoe that seems shoe-horned in as if he were visiting from a different movie.\\n\\nWorse is what comes next. Hazel and Augustus visit Anne Frank\\'s house. Naturally, Hazel has trouble climbing the series of steep staircases. When she reaches the famous attic, there is little to no attention paid to the fact that they are in Anne Frank\\'s famous hiding place. Instead, the scene climaxes with Hazel and Augustus\\'s first kiss, to which all the strangers around them begin to applaud.\\n\\nThe movie never really deals with the issue of what it is like to live with cancer, or the inevitability that it will claim your life. The dialogue lightly dances around these issues but no one ever gets serious about discussing them. They know they\\'re going to die but neither Augustus nor Hazel ever get down to the serious business of discussing what lies on the other side. Augustus talks a lot about \"oblivion\", which indicates that he is an atheist, but the movie doesn\\'t go there. We know from the beginning that one or both characters will face the final curtain before the movie is over, but the film\\'s final act is a long – very long – series of slow passages about eulogies and final wishes that goes on and on and on. It should be moving us to tears but you find yourself checking your watch instead.\\n\\nHazel informs us in the beginning that \"Pain deserves to be felt.\" We agree, but the movie could do with a lot more pain and a lot less catharsis. The characters talk and talk and talk and talk, but nothing they have to say has any real meaning. Death is the inevitability of this story, but there\\'s such a long and drawn-out funerary tone to the film\\'s third act that is tinged with so much hope and finality that it feels like the happiest sad ending you\\'ve ever seen.',\n",
       " 'The reason I am rating this a 1 is to combat the insane 8.2 rating that this terrible movie has.\\n\\nI\\'m a 17 year old girl, and most people would assume someone my age would fall head over heels for a movie like this. I watched expecting to see this amazingly realistic, incomparable, and tragically beautiful love story, which is how TFIOS had been described to me. After spending two hours watching this movie, I\\'m sitting here wondering if I\\'m made of stone considering I did not shed a single tear. But several movies I have watched, and stories I have read, have left me sobbing and attempting to recover for days. I have never read the book, or any of John Green\\'s books for that matter but now I will forever hold the opinion that he is a fully grown man attempting to articulate not only the life of a teenage girl, but the life of someone suffering with a disease. The first few lines of the movie, narrated by Hazel, made me know I was going to hate this movie, since she was describing things that happened in cliché romance stories (which is exactly what this is), and how this was \"true.\" The idea that this movie was realistic is ridiculous. First of all, a few token one-liners in the movie were clever and well written, but would never come out of a teenager\\'s mouth. As a teenager myself, I can confirm that we are not that profound. I didn\\'t understand the appeal that either of the main characters had in the other, other than the fact they both had cancer. Hazel was boring, and selfish, and self-pitying, and Gus was so pretentious it made me feel sick, and I never believed for a second that he was a virgin. Of course cancer is a terrible thing, as is death itself, but the fact that I didn\\'t care about either of them, and saw them as a caricature of what John Green thinks or wants teenagers with cancer to act like, made me completely indifferent to their predictable demise. The story line with them going to Amsterdam to visit the author of their favorite book was annoying and unnecessary. Although the author was painted as this terrible person, I actually agreed everything that came out of his mouth about Hazel. I\\'m pretty sure the whole point of that scene was to say \"hey, what can we do to make this movie even more depressing? I know, let\\'s take the one thing that the main character cares about and destroy it, in order to make her completely dependent on her love interest.\" There\\'s too many complaints I have about specific eye-roll inducing lines and scenes in this movie to even remember, but the one that angered me more than anything was when they went to the Anne Frank house. First, they tried to compare the horrible death of Anne Frank and her family, which was an outcome of the most horrible thing that has happened in human history, to these teenagers dying with cancer. As soon as they reached the top floor of the house, paying attention only to Hazel struggling to climb the stairs, in my mind I started thinking \"please make them be respectful. I swear, if Gus tries to crack a self-righteous joke I will punch my laptop screen.\" At first, I was pleasantly surprised, because they were quiet and solemn, but then, they begin making out... Only to make it worse, everyone in the room begins clapping. Why? If I was there, I would be furious at their lack of respect. I can only hope this scene wasn\\'t filmed in the actual house. Towards the end I was constantly checking the bar at the bottom of my screen to see how long I had left. I kept thinking, when is this really sad part coming that will make me cry? and when the credits started rolling, I realized it never would. The fact that people are describing this piece of trash as the best movie they have ever seen boggles my mind. I\\'m assuming it\\'s the first movie they have ever seen. If you want to watch a realistic romance movie, you won\\'t find it here. Don\\'t waste your time.',\n",
       " \"I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real. I will read the book again and see the movie again - it is worth it.\",\n",

The audience is led to believe she is smart because she read the same book 1000 times over (doing that isn\\'t smart) and goes to college (which she doesn\\'t really).\\n\\nShe goes to a support group where good hearted, Christian, cancer survivor (which is made to look like a loser) helps young people who have cancer. \\n\\nThere, she meets 2 characters: 1) eye cancer guy who is going to have to remove them and has a huge boobed (to good for him) girlfriend, who will leave him 10 minutes later. 2) his friend, an extremely athletic, pretty, extremely confident guy (even though he\\'s a virgin (yeah right *rolls eyes*)) who is also a cancer survivor (lost a leg to it, but is paradoxically still very athletic). \\n\\nEven though his value on the meat market is much higher than the protagonist girl\\'s value, he only has eyes for her, even without her saying anything but depressing things.\\n\\nAt the end of the meeting, if being athletic, pretty and confident isn\\'t enough, a girl passes by him trying to get his attention (to show that even other girls are into him), so that the main girl can be certain that he\\'s an alpha male, but she still give\\'s him a hard time (because in every romantic movie a guy has to prove himself even beyond the shadow of a doubt that he\\'s the man for a boring girl (the exception is when there are 2 awesome guys fighting for the same girl (Twilight))).\\n\\nThey start talking on the phone and she lends him her favorite book. \\n\\nThe leg cancer guy says that her book is amazing. And since the spoiled brat cancer girl has some stupid question she wants to make to the author, he decides to get them both a trip to Europe to talk to the writer of the book. He could get anything for himself, but he decides to give his special once in a lifetime cancer wish to her, even though they are not boyfriend/girlfriend, they have not had sex, they haven\\'t even kissed yet.\\n\\nHer doctor is the ugliest actor, so you know he\\'s going to be the bad guy. He tells her that she can\\'t take the trip in any possible way! She goes anyway (obviously).\\n\\nIn the generic romantic European country, the guy decides to use a tux (which all men love to wear... Not!) to take her to a very expensive dinner (which although he doesn\\'t end up having to pay, he was more than happy to be able to pay for her!).\\n\\nThe author seems to be a reasonable guy, he tells them in other words that the book ended the way it should have ended, that her questions are stupid and that she\\'s a spoiled brat/ narcissist (which is all true).\\n\\nShe gets sad, boy comforts her and tells her he could write a better ending then the author (no he couldn\\'t, and if that\\'s the case, why couldn\\'t she? and why did they come in the first place?), they decide to go to Anne Frank\\'s house. She\\'s tired of going upstairs because of her lung cancer. When she\\'s at the place where Anne Frank hid, she kisses the boy. Other tourists who were there clap for the blatant disrespect of Anne\\'s suffering because they\\'re Nazis(it\\'s the only reasonable explanation). This clapping cheers them on to having sex.\\n\\nAt this point me and my girlfriend were discussing going out of the theater before the end, because it was so bad and cliché, but we stayed, just in case the end was amazing to make up for all this bulls...\\n\\nThey go back to America. Guy has cancer again and becomes depressed (He knew it before going to Europe, but only gets depressed about it now, w t f?!). In his depression he stops talking to girl (because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking). He starts talking to girl again... about death. Girl writes eulogy for boy, and reads it to him. Boy dies, it\\'s time for her to read eulogy (I\\'m thinking: she\\'s obviously not going to read the same thing again, because that would be boring for the audience of the movie) and then she doesn\\'t read it! (what?! who saw that coming except for everyone!?). She decides to say bland feel good lies in his funeral, instead of the truth, because she\\'s a conformist narcissist coward. \\n\\nGirl gets a paper that leg cancer boy wrote to her before he died. I barely remember, but it\\'s some romantic BS. The end.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a scene I don\\'t remember exactly when in the movie that shows how deep does narcissism goes in the girl: She says that she knows that when she dies, her parents are not going to be able to do anything anymore, shrivel and die, because she\\'s dead. Her parents are like: No, we aren\\'t. Get over yourself.\\n\\nHighlight of the movie: Another guy plays violin for a short bit of time.',\n",
       " 'I honestly can\\'t imagine how anyone with a sense of good writing, good directing, or good acting could ever think this movie is entertaining past the humor of its flaws. Do you people have brains? These actors may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting. It would have made no difference. The only impressive \"skills\" displayed came when the girl cries after AUGUSTUS (so pretentious)passes away. \\n\\nThe only thing that kept me engaged in this movie after I had started watching was the curiosity of which one dies first. There were points when I was rooting for the death of them together just so the movie would end.\\n\\nThis review isn\\'t coming from someone heartless. I admit that I teared up when Hazel bawls her eyes out, but that doesn\\'t make the movie good. That just means I sympathize with someone who is crying. That says nothing about the quality of the film. \\n\\nWhat happened IMDb? I can usually trust your ratings. I\\'ve never written a review here before but when I saw that this was higher than an 8, I had to say something.\\n\\nThis is a weak tearjerker for the weak-minded.',\n",

I was unfortunate enough to accompany two 15 year old girls with my friend and was shocked that girls that age want to waste their time sobbing uncontrollably on a Friday evening when there is a whole world out there waiting for them.\\n\\nThe acting .... Oh my gosh .... The worst I've ever seen. Gus was unbearable, smug and frankly creepy. And as for her mother - patronizing is an understatement! I just struggled to watch them all make fools of themselves in this silly, ridiculous film.\\n\\nWhat rubbish are we feeding our teens? We had to point out to my friend's daughter who thought Gus was such a catch that life just isn't like this. During the movie one girl clattered noisily out the cinema strangled by sobs and the row in front of us shook with heart-wrenching wails as my friend and I shook with laughter.\\n\\nGet real kids.

See if you can spot it!! I also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and distracting. My last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film. Some scenes can feel odd – and that is because they are out of place. In addition, the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking. Sadly the film did not quite make it.\\n\\nI may be focusing too much on the negatives. I did rather enjoy the film and thought the book was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone contemplating. Enjoy!',\n",

Have someone on the BIG screen cry for a few minutes... the audience will cry too, of course. It's like the yawning that's contagious... But why was it that I didn't care at all for ANY of the characters, by the end of the movie?... The only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news about his death... But even that wasn't connected emotionally to anything else in the movie... I can list a hundred movies that are WAY more emotional than this pile of artificial cr*p... And what the f**k is with that pack of cigarettes on the boy's coffin? I know cigarettes eventually PUT you in the coffin, but his was not the case...
