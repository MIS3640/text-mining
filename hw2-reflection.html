            Project Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            For this homework project I aimed to analyze the reviews for the movie called The Fault in Our Stars. I chose this movie because
            I had mixed feelings after watching it and couldn't decide whether I liked it or not, so I wanted to know the thoughts of the public. To get the data, I 
            used a package called imdbpie. As for the technique, I applied Sentiment analysis using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() function from nltk package, which 
            uses Natural Language Processing to process the data. I also looked at the word frequency for the nouns and adjectives using another function from nltk.         
        </p>

        <h3>
            Implementation 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first major component of my project is the retrieval of data. In order to get the reviews of The Fault in Our Stars,
            I had to get its IMDB ID from its IMDB url and used it as a reference to retrieve the data from the imdbpie package. In this project
            I only retrieved the movie title and the reviews in IMDB. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the second major component, I had to prepare the data for analysis. This step included tokenization, cleaning the data, and identifying parts-of-speech tags. 
            Tokenization refers to splitting the chunk of reviews into separate sentences and words. I needed this to access each sentence and word of each review. 
            Next, I cleaned the data by removing stop words and punctuations. This allowed me to filter out words that are unnecessary. Stop words are words that don't contribute significant meaning
            to the text analysis (example: to, and, i, etc.) I got the list of stop words from the nltk package, and the list of punctuation marks from the string package. 
            For the final step in data preparation, I identified the parts-of-speech tag for each word. This way, I was able to identify the nouns and adjectives in the 
            reviews. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The final major component is data visualization and sentiment analysis. For the first one, I looked at the top 15 nouns in the review. This provides
            contextual information about the movie, allowing the user to get a sense of what the movie is about. For the second one, I checked the top 15 adjectives. This shows
            what the IMDB users think of the movie overall. Lastly, I performed a seentiment analysis for 
            each of the sentences in the review section, to determine if they are either positive, negative, or neutral. For this step I used the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() function from nltk package, which computes the 
            sentiment scores for each tokenized sentence (positive, neutral, negative, compound). 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Results
        </h3>
        <p>
            For the 15 most common nouns, I displayed the results in a Frequency distribution plot, which is a function in the nltk package that counts the number of each type of word. (See image below) 
            I found out these are (in order of most frequent): movie, book, hazel, cancer, love, story, film, girl, read, guy, augustus, time, life, scene, and end.
            I suppose that this graph will be useful for someone who hasn't watched the movie as it gives them the idea that the movie is a love story that is based on a book, and features
            characters named "Hazel" and "Augustus", one of whom has cancer.

        <p>
            I also used a Frequency distribution plot to display the result for the 15 most common adjectives (See image below)
            I got the following results (in order of most frequent): good, best, much, true, real, romantic, great, fantastic, able, emotional, big, green, many, entire, little. 
            From this list, it's safe to assume that the movie was received in a postive light. It's interesting to see the word "real" included in this list,
            because in my opinion, nothing about the movie is realistic. However, the word might be referring to "real love", so I might be wrong in my assumption.

        </div>
        <p>
            For the sentiment analysis, I presented the sentiment scores for each sentence in a table using pandas dataframe. I also created another
            dataframe to display the summary or descriptive statistics of all the sentiment scores. 
            The dataframe has 387 rows (See image below) which means that I was able to get the sentiment scores of 387 sentences in the IMDB review section of The Fault in Our Stars.
            The results from the second dataframe (See second image below) show that the average sentence in the review section had a positive score of 0.149, a neutral score of 0.766, negative score of 0.084, and a compound score of 0.114.
            What this means is that the average feedback was indifferent or neutral. The more the compound score is closer to 1, the higher the positivity of the text.

            Reflection
        </h3>
        <p>
            Overall, for a beginner, I think that this project was a success. There were some technical obstacles that I had to face, such as working with Pandas and simple things like iterating through a list of list, so I had to
            review past concepts in class while working on this project. There were also a lot of resources online that helped improve my understanding of text analysis using nltk and how to approach my project.
            In the end, I was able to debug my code and the program worked as how I wanted it to. However, I feel that I could have improved my project by increasing its scope. It would have been better if I analyzed more than 1 movie, 
            or even compare results between 2-3 movies. I feel that I could have also improved the sentiment analysis by look at the total number of positive and negative reviews.
            Considering that I completed this project individually, I am still happy with the outcome. I'm really glad that I was able to take advantage of all the learning opportunities, which
            I wouldn't have if I had teammates. I didn't know how to perform NLP techniques beforehand, but after familirizing myself with terms and processes, I can say that it made me want to learn it more in-depth and even rejuvenated 
            my interest in coding. I had a lot of fun doing this project.
