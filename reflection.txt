One of the many ways investigators can trace unknown authors to a known author is through the use of text
analysis. There has long been a debate over the legitimacy of Shakespeare and his authorship.
One of the main theories to who he may actually have been is sir Francis Bacon. In this project
I set out to analyze the texts of the two and see if there were any interesting relationships between
their works.

To do this I used the Gutenberg library to pull both the works of Shakespeare and Bacon. I decided to use
Macbeth as an example of Shakespeare's work, and Bacon'sEssays and Wisdom of the Ancients. Bacon primarily
wrote aobut science, and this was one of his only works in flowing english rahter than scientific.

Our program scraped the data from the Gutenberg project website, then created two lists of the words and 
their counts. We then zipped these files together to create a dictionary in decending order. Initally 
many of the words at the begining of the list were the same such as 'the' and so on. These are called
"stop words", I found a data set of all the known stop words at: http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words
we used these to create a list which could be compared to our list and remove any words that would not
be useful for our analysis. I initally wanted to use lists to remove these in the final data, but after
second thought I decided on using dictionary instead and removing the stop words as a list before.

After the analysis, I could not find any speicifc words that would have pointed to Bacon being the author
behind Shakespeare's plays. In the analysis I was looking for speicifc words that were not nouns that seemed
out of place. One or two of these could be used to make the argument of shared authorship, but that is not the case.
