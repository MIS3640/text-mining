# Assignment 2: Text Analysis and Text Mining
## By Kristina Ferguson and Alex Rosemond

## 1. Project Overview
The data source we decided to use was IMDb, which provided us with data on movies and the focus of our assignment: their reviews. We used imdbpie to bring in the data and then indexing to pinpoint the text of the review. To analyze the text, we first created a histogram for word frequency, then sorted it to find the most used words for the document, and lastly, we ran sentiment analysis on the text. Through this assignment, we hoped to practice and further solidify our skills in extracting specific information from a data source and utilizing the extracted information to perform interesting analyses. Furthermore, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the capabilities of natural language processing, specifically sentiment analysis, as well as hopefully find some new movies that we can watch to relax after completing this assignment. 

## 2. Implementation 

Our first step was to load all of the IMBd data into python. When we imported the data, it was formatted in a dictionary. The dictionary included information for each movie and the information we were looking for: information on the reviews such as the rating and the text of the review. After collecting the data from IMDb we then used indexing to isolate only the text of each review. We wanted to be able to return either a random review or choose a specific review, so we included random as well as two optional arguments that allows the user to receive a random review or to pick a specific one. To start the analysis we first started with a word frequency dictionary that uses each unique word in the review’s text as a key and the number of appearances of that word as the value. In the function for this part, we used the module strings to identify punctuation, and use that as a reference to remove all punctuation from the text. This cleaning along with making each word lowercase ensures that the frequency of each word is accurate, by preventing python from considering a word unique due to period at the end (‘end.’) or an uppercase (‘The’ versus ‘the’). After creating the word frequency dictionary we wanted to see the words sorted from greatest to least occurrences. When coding to achieve the new list, we decided that we should remove stopwords from the list because stopwords make up a large portion of sentences despite not adding much to the meaning of the sentence. Once the stopwords were removed, converting the dictionary into tuples and sorting it in a list allows us to see the words with the highest frequency and understand what the reviewer was mainly concerned with. Finally, we utilized the nltk package in python in order to run a sentiment analysis on each review to gain an overall sense of whether or not the review was more positive or more negative. We also decided to create a function that would calculate the lexical diversity of that review in order to gain a better understanding of the complexity of the review, and therefore the more value and insight that could be gained from the review. 

## 3. Results 
There was a lot of buzz around the movie Parasite when it came out so we wanted to use this movie to perform our analysis, use as an example in our discussion, and derive insights into the performance of our code. We ran the code several times to get different samples of various reviews to formulate our opinion on the movie. Overall, the results seem to be that Parasite is a thought-provoking, suspenseful movie that is worth watching. Some of the key words that we noticed became a theme throughout all the reviews were that it was a “masterpiece,” “suspenseful,” and “metaphorical.” The compound sentiment scores for the movie were usually quite high (ranging from around 0.72 to 0.99), but of course there were some critics of the movie that did not think it was as poetic and thought-provoking as the vast majority, which was reflected in their compound sentiment score of roughly -0.80. We wanted to verify the accuracy of the sentiment analysis by comparing it to the actual rating that the reviewer gave. For the most part, the sentiment analysis was very similar to the rating the reviewer actually gave. When the compound sentiment score was high (above 0.9) the reviewer had indeed given the movie a high rating of 9 or 10. There were some instances where there were discrepancies in the sentiment score and the actual rating. These instances were usually when the review had more nuanced language that had underlying meanings that are only easily interpreted by a human. Other instances were when they included words that negated the following words (such as ”it was NOT metaphorical”), but since sentiment is calculated on a word by word basis it was not able to catch this detail in an accurate way. 

The sorted dictionary was useful in pulling out keywords from the reviews that were used to describe the movie. This allowed us to get a quick understanding of the general overview of the movie and what people thought of it without needing to parse through the entirety of several lengthy reviews. This simplified the process of going through reviews to get a sense of the themes and quality of the movie as well as significantly reduced the time it took to do so. However, one limitation was that, at times, some keywords could be misleading as to their true meaning or the value that one could derive from them was reduced without the larger context of the entire sentence. 

One of the trends that we noticed throughout the process of our analysis was that across all of the sentiment analysis scores, the neutral category was the highest among all 3 categories (positive, neutral, negative). This is not entirely surprising as there are a lot of articles or other words that are used to build the overall sentence structure rather than providing real meaning to the sentence. Due to this, there are a small amount of words that make a significant contribution to determining whether the compound score will be more positive or more negative. Another trend that we noticed was that when the review was shorter in length it usually received a higher lexical diversity score.

## 4. Reflection 
 
From a process point of view, the various elements of analysis that we created are valuable in evaluating the quality of movies based on reviews. However, the program that we wrote is moreso made for other programmers and not easily used by someone that is not familiar with python. In order to use the IMBd data and the sentiment analysis functions the user must be aware that they have to install these packages in the command prompt on their computer, which someone who is unfamiliar with python or these packages most likely would not know. Due to conflicts in our schedules we primarily worked separately on this project. We split the task into two portions - one person performed Part 1 of the assignment, which was harvesting the text, as well as created code in order to perform sentiment analysis. The other person primarily worked on creating the code in order to find the word frequencies and sort them in a way that would generate more value from the list. Additionally, since they could only begin their work once the first person had finished, they were tasked with checking over the first person's code and improving upon it where necessary. Overall, working in this manner worked very well for our team and each member of our team completed tasks by the respective deadlines we set. If either one of us had a problem arise while working on our section, the other person would find time in order to jump on a quick call or communicate via text in order to quickly resolve the issue as a team.
