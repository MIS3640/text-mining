The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like \"What are they, kidding?\", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. \n\nThis was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.\n\nBruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the \"Classy Villain that Gotham needs\", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's \"White Knight\" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.\n\nAll the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.\n\n10/10", "reviewTitle": "The Batman of our dreams!

But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.\n\nThis isn't an action movie.

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace.

After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".\n\nThough my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.\n\nChristian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.\n\nCountering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?\n\nInitially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.\n\nBe it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.", "reviewTitle": "The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2008-07-16", "titleId": "/title/tt0468569/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Mush_Man29", "userId": "/user/ur13846894/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6601962695656636, "id": "/title/tt0468569/userreviews/rw1911625", "interestingVotes": {"down": 567, "up": 1217}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.\n\nIt is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.\n\nAll the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.\n\nIf Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.\n\nThere are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.\n\nI was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.\n\nAll in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.\n\nIf you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.\n\nStunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation...

Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.\n\nI will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.\n\nOf course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...\n\nAll the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for Smoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.\n\nWally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.\n\nNevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.\n\nIt may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.\n\n5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!", "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2008-07-16", "titleId": "/title/tt0468569/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "LennyRenquist", "userId": "/user/ur2371300/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6426316594208072, "id": "/title/tt0468569/userreviews/rw1911671", "interestingVotes": {"down": 460, "up": 925}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.

He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.\n\nThe film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next.

No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.\n\nThe cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences.

Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.\n\n(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros.

The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.\n\nThere are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250.

The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.\n\nThe bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.\n\nLedger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.\n\nAlthough Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers.

So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like \"Batman Begins\" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be \"152 minutes of pure awesomeness.\" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing \"Batman Begins\" will not be disappointed.

Within 10 minutes of the first episode, the basic rules of   the theme park are established: paying guests called \"newcomers\" get to   interact with androids called \"hosts\" (which to the naked eye are   indiscernible from the guests) in a world dressed up like the Old West   - and in this world, the guest truly is king. The rules are brutally   simple: the visitors get to do whatever they like with - or to - the   androids. They can have a friendly chat with them, flirt with them or   embark on a spontaneous (or scripted) adventure with them - but they   can also shoot them, rape them, torture them and kill them at will.   Imagine a real-life version of the game 'Grand Theft Auto' (in a   slightly different setting) and you'll get the idea.\n\nThe androids, on the other hand, are constructed and programmed in a   way that is supposed to inhibit them from physically harming \"living\"   creatures. At the beginning of the show - thanks to an interesting   choice of storytelling - we get to experience Westworld from the   perspective of the androids, which reveals a cruel detail about their   nature: they apparently experience emotions. Artificial or not, they do   feel pain and fear - as well as affection and anger, and they have no   idea that they don't count as \"real\" people (at least not to those who   call themselves real people). And while that detail certainly makes the   \"game\" even more thrilling and more realistic for the visitors, it   means that the shocking abuse some of the androids have to suffer is   harrowingly real to them.\n\nThe way the show is constructed - so far - it immediately confronts the   viewer with very uncomfortable questions. How do we as humans behave   towards creatures we consider non-human? How excessive do we become and how thin does our layer of morality turn out to be if we're allowed to   live out all our fantasies without having to fear any consequences for   our actions? And at what point should a creature have rights similar to   those we demand for ourselves? How do we define \"sentient\"? How do we   define \"human\"? And how well do we actually understand - and how well   are we able to control - the amazing technology our species seems to   have acquired so suddenly?\n\nAs an avid film fan, I found 'Westworld' immediately intriguing; not   only because it dares to challenge the viewer with fascinating   philosophical questions and scientific concepts, but also because its   premise offers the chance to explore a wide range of film genres: sci-   fi, western, drama, horror - to name but a few. In the first few   episodes alone, there are hints of many of my favorite films and   stories such as (obviously) 'Frankenstein', 'Blade Runner', 'A.I.', 'Ex   Machina', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Truman Show' and 'Rise of the Planet of   the Apes' (and I suspect somewhere down the road there will be a strong   'Spartacus' vibe). As for the non plot related aspects of the show:   production design, music and effects are fantastic - as we've come to   expect from HBO's high concept productions - and, with very few   exceptions, the impressive ensemble of high caliber actors do a great   job at bringing their respective characters to life (artificial and   otherwise).\n\nA special mention needs to go to Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins: their   charismatic screen presence is once more just impossible to ignore and   they simply own every scene they're in. Generally speaking, there   really isn't much to complain about in 'Westworld' (so far), and I'm   pretty sure HBO have another winner. Given the amount of talent   involved, anything else actually would have been surprising. Produced   by J.J. Abrams, created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy Nolan based on a   concept by the late - great - Michael Crichton; directed by Neil   Marshall and Vincenzo Natali (among others), and with a cast most shows   would kill for, the stars really seem to have aligned for 'Westworld'.\n\nMy overall verdict so far: 'Westworld' is intelligent science fiction   for adults (some scenes are very graphic) which offers more than just   eye candy and is full of mysteries for the patient viewer to uncover.   The show's main themes may not be new, but I found the way they are   presented never less than compelling. It succeeds in creating a   powerful metaphor for oppression, and by showing how quickly humans   tend to deem \"un-humane\" treatment of other beings acceptable - once   they've managed to convince themselves they're \"less\" human than they   are - the show drove a point home that resonated strongly with me. 8   stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/", "reviewTitle": "How do we define \"human\"?", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2016-10-03", "titleId": "/title/tt0475784/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "letshaveagoodtm", "userId": "/user/ur64304615/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6398299556847122, "id": "/title/tt0475784/userreviews/rw3571210", "interestingVotes": {"down": 328, "up": 665}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Pay attention, this series explores some very subtle story lines.

It takes a very bleak view of humanity. I love the original film though I'm biased in favour of 1970s pop culture and somewhat anti what we have nowadays, but it's such a dark show there's very little chance of feeling any affection towards it.\n\nThis Westworld features nary a single likeable character and is overwhelmingly nihilistic, unpleasantly violent (I don't have a problem with violence on screen but it goes out of its way to make every violent incident really nasty), relentlessly foul-mouthed (much of the dialogue is deeply crude) and about as far from 'fun' as could be. It is implausible, to put it mildly, and deeply pretentious.\n\nSlow and massively verbose, it tells a multi-character story that elicits little sympathy. And it's all as PC as you'd expect nowadays: at least three of the female characters are basically male. The Thandie Newton character, presumably because she's a woman AND a bit black, is like some sort of superhero: she's far wiser, more charismatic, stronger and more able than any of the puny males here. Many of the males are quislings, cowards, vain, motivated by base motives etc.\n\nTwo of the actors have expressions that never change - Leonardo Nam (anxious) and Evan Rachel Wood (a little downcast; confused about her life). Angela Sarafyan treads a fine line between looking beautiful and possessing a sort of down syndrome chic. Anthony Hopkins at least doesn't phone his performance in like he has many times in the past, but his crinkled face quarter-smile irks a little. At least he isn't as flat-out foul and depressingly nasty as Ptolemy Slocum's character, who brings down every scene he's in. And I can see why Ed Harris wears that hat.\n\nWestworld is nasty, gloomy, grim stuff, whose underlying message is that people are horrible (especially white males), that life is brutish and unsatisfying, that people manipulate other people all the time, that rich people are especially awful, that there is no such thing as 'real' pleasure.

Looking through some of the negative reviews of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion was one of those moments. It's a procedural movie that is meant to capture the wide-ranging reality of a massive disease outbreak in the modern era, not a three act drama with character arcs. It's simply a different type of movie than a lot of people are used to, so they don't know how to process it. Anyway...\n\nOne of the many things I love about this film is that it starts with Day 2, not Day 1. We don't see the actual origin of the outbreak until the very end of the film when it jumps back in time, so we spend the majority of the film trying to navigate the confusion that is the outbreak. We want to know the source, but we know as little as the WHO and CDC officials trying to track it. Alongside that tracking, though, is the human cost of the disease.\n\nThat's mostly handled through Matt Damon's character who watches his wife and stepson die as some of the very first victims of the disease, though he seems to be immune. I expected the film to follow a convention that Damon would be the key to the cure, but it simply never brings up the idea and he's just left to tend to his daughter as they navigate the breakdown of law and order.\n\nThe disease spreads quickly, though, and no one in the disease prevention industry can get a grasp on it. They first have trouble limiting it, all efforts of which prove to be futile. Then they have trouble replicating it in a lab setting, which only gets fixed with a non-government doctor ignores orders to destroy his samples and continues his work. They then have trouble figuring out how to actually attack it, until one of the chief scientists circumvents procedure and injects herself with the most promising vaccine they've developed up to that point. Then, the story's still not over, because while they do have the vaccine, they also have millions and millions of people who need it, and they can only make so much at a time, so a lottery gets developed to distribute it out by birthdate.\n\nAnother way the movie captures the messy reality of this situation is how it uses its characters in the press. There are two, a journalist for a San Francisco paper and a blogger. The journalist is completely uninterested in the first steps of the disease as they unfold because it's just not corroborated or big enough. The blogger, though, is an anti-vaccine advocate and jumps on the story to feed his own biases. The journalist is too slow, and the blogger ends up using his position as a perceived prophet to profit off of the hysteria by pushing a bunk cure.\n\nThe use of major movie stars in seemingly small roles is a very smart decision as well. One of its biggest stars, Gwyneth Paltrow, dies in the first twenty minutes. Another of the major stars dies within an hour. The movie uses star power intelligently, telling the audience that this disease can take out anyone. It increases the tension by helping to cloud the resolution.\n\nIt's a movie about this ever changing process to get an unseen threat that's debilitating the world order under control. It's not about characters going through big emotional changes with catharsis for them at the end of the film. It's a thriller on a global scale. What it sets out to do, it does extremely well. I think it's one of the most effective thrillers in decades.", "reviewTitle": "A great procedural thriller on a global scale", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-13", "titleId": "/title/tt1598778/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "alejandroharris", "userId": "/user/ur34721777/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.8780360326359602, "id": "/title/tt1598778/userreviews/rw5446707", "interestingVotes": {"down": 33, "up": 339}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I really recommend this movie to watch with your families and friends during this season.

OK, the virus in the movie was way too deadly and with a short incubation period, but that made it more easy to contain. The vaccine was developed incredibly fast, too.

At the time it was to me (just as to everybody) another addition to the genre that is best represented by \"Outbreak\" (1995). Watching \"Contagion\" it again, I feel a cold shudder down my spine. You get the uncanny feeling that director Steven Soderbergh is one of those Biblical prophets. \"Contagion\" talks about a pandemic getting out of control, about the race to develop a vaccine, about incubation periods (in that movie thankfully less than 10 days), about people's unconscious habit of touching their faces (from 2 times to 1000 times a day, depending on the individual), about tracking down virus carriers (doctor telling such a carrier, urgently over the cell phone, to immediately leave the bus, don't talk to anyone, don't touch anyone), people in power trying to hide the truth, nurses' threat on work-stoppage, The most chilling thing: millions died worldwide.\n\nThe movie starts with \"patient 0\", the first one to contract the virus and die. But cunningly, the movie starts at \"Day 2\", showing the victim's contact with various people, as captured in a casino's video. It is only at the end of the movie that we finally get to see \"Day 1\" showing the victim shaking hand with a chef. What has not been captured on video is that the chef has just been handling some slaughtered pigs. When the chain goes back, it finally reached its source: bats.\n\nWithin the first 20 minutes, there are no less than three Oscar Best Lead Actresses but that's not all. Gwyneth Paltrow is the first victim in the movie, appearing only briefly at the beginning when she contacts the disease in either Hong Kong or Macau and dies soon after going home to the U.S. Through flashbacks, an investigative series tries to find the source, which is disclosed only in the very last shot. Matt Damon plays her husband who loses both her and her son (his stepson) but is himself immune. His only emotional support now is his teenage daughter (Anna Jacoby-Heron) from his first marriage who hurries to his side at the tragedy.\n\nLaurence Fishburne is the deputy director of the Centre and Disease Control, who has the unenviable job of facing the public. His own story includes sending a trusted friend and colleague (Kate Winslet) to handle an affected region and, tragically, to her death. His care for another colleague (Monique Gabriela Curnen), whom he later marries, leads him to disclosing to her privileged information. Overhearing this is a janitor (John Hawkes, who recently had a marvelous performance in \"Winter's bone\" as \"Teardrop\") who seeks the rare vaccine for his son.\n\nThe story of Marion Cotillard's character is a little far-fetched but not totally unrealistic. A World Health Organization investigator sent to the Far East, she is kidnapped by a local man (Chin Han) for ransom in the form of the vaccines to save his village.\n\nThe best performance in the movie comes from Jennifer Ehle (mesmerizing as Christabel LaMotte in \"Possession\" and also appeared in The King's Speech as Geoffrey Rush's character the speech therapist wife) as the doctor who discovers the vaccine.\n\nJude Law steals quite a few shows as a blogger with zero scruples trying to make money out of this biological disaster of global proportion.\n\nTowards the end of the movie, a clever, simple shot is used to signify that the deadly new epidemic is finally under control - a three-layer box containing specimens is put into the lab's archive. The bottom drawer, looking quite new, is for this new string. The top two layers, looking warn and rusty, are labelled respectively \"SARS\" and \"H1N1\".

That's what you'll be doing after you see this film. Contagion is a frightening realistic procedural thriller about the spread of an airborne pandemic virus, its impact on an ensemble cast of characters played by a veritable 'Who's Who' of Hollywood and the subsequent race to find a cure.\n\nLike his earlier work 'Traffic', Soderbergh skilfully interweaves the various story lines into a bigger picture that breathlessly tracks and encircles the globe. The cast do not let him down. It's impossible to see a bad performance from Matt Damon and once again his role as a grieving father is sensitively and painfully played. We really feel his sense of sudden and unexpected loss as he struggles to internalise the news of his wife's death, disbelieving, dazed and confused. Marion Cotillard adds an international hue to her role as a World Health Organisation investigator whilst Jude Law plays the role of an insidious Australian blogger, who dangerously undermines the medical establishment's attempts to find a cure for his own conspiratorial and financial gains, to perfection. I could go on; Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle and John Hawkes all provide solid support in a starry cast.\n\nWhat makes this film so compelling is the way Soderbergh is able to show how unhygienic human beings are and how easy it is to create a pandemic. In hundreds of different absent minded ways we touch our faces on a daily basis and in doing so, transfer and spread dangerous viruses amongst ourselves. Next time you're in the supermarket look out for the number of people who pick their noses, wipe their mouths and cough, sneeze and splutter their way past you without any attempts to cover their mouths. They're picking up (and putting back) the fruit and vegetables, handling groceries and even touching your hand when supermarket staff are giving back your card or change! Worse still, a recent survey showed that although 95% of people say they wash their hands, only 12% actually do so and consequently 1 in 6 mobile phones have faecal bacterial on them and 30% of all handbags. I could go on.\n\nDespite a slightly preposterous storyline when Cotillard is kidnapped in Hong Kong, Soderbergh does portray the breakdown of society in an uncomfortably truthful way when people are suddenly and unexpectedly faced with their own extinction and the instincts of self preservation take over. This could have been explored a little further around the world although at all times the story is grounded in reality. Even the death toll of 27 million worldwide in four months has the ring of truth about it and this is due in no small part to the film's chief scientific adviser, Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University. The televised national lottery in the film is something that I could see happening in the interests of fairness and impartiality when the supply of vaccines is unable to keep up with demand when life and death is only one injection away.\n\nAt the film's closing credits one thing stands out and that is the unheralded and heroic work of the thousands of doctors, microbiologists, virologists and vaccine researchers around the world who labour night and day to minimise the effects of such a pandemic occurring which might wipe out the human race. If you're a pessimist like me in this age of global warming, massive deforestation, the depletion of the earth's natural resources, the extinction of wildlife habitats, overpopulation and overcrowding, go figure...a pandemic like the one portrayed in Contagion is inevitable (and long overdue according to the scientific world). The only question that remains is how many people will it kill? Anyway, go and see the film \u2013 it's a thought provoking and scary chiller that taps into the current zeitgeist.", "reviewTitle": "Go and wash your hands...NOW!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2011-10-26", "titleId": "/title/tt1598778/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "KnightsofNi11", "userId": "/user/ur10398346/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6768263337510353, "id": "/title/tt1598778/userreviews/rw2486753", "interestingVotes": {"down": 54, "up": 154}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "One would think that the last thing we need is another outbreak movie. But that's not the case when the latest of the genre is directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. Contagion wins for this years most ridiculously impressive cast lineup, as it is an ensemble picture about a deadly viral outbreak that affects the entire world. We follow various characters like a man who loses his wife and step son to the disease. We follow various doctors who work to stop the virus, along with CDC officials who must control the spread and influence of the virus. The whole film is a tightly woven dramatic thriller that presents a lot of characters and a lot of ideas, but keeps them all in line and pulls its story off very well.\n\nIt's not always easy to keep an ensemble cast straight, especially when the main plot of the film is run by subplots from the various characters and their stories that continue throughout the film. The stories weave in and out of each other at times, but often they are all separate, just lead by the same main plot of a viral outbreak affecting the entire population of the world. Thankfully, Contagion interweaves its characters and story lines at just the right intervals, forming a very structured and well crafted end result. There are essentially four main stories that intertwine. There's the father character's story, the CDC, the scientists trying to stop the disease, and a blogger who claims to already have a cure for the disease. These four stories get basically equal screen time and all serve a purpose towards thickening the film's plot. The way they work together and separate is impressive and makes for a very strong overall narrative.\n\nSoderbergh takes a very minimalist approach to Contagion, steering clear of anything flashy or exaggerated and avoiding over-dramatic relationships and big budget set pieces. This makes Contagion a very unique experience and something much different from your typical viral outbreak flick. It does lag in spots as the film attempts to stretch out certain things without doing anything flashy. The film takes a very low key and eerily monotone approach to its storytelling. It seems to choose the simplest solution to things which in turn makes it a more fascinating and much more realistic feeling than something glitzy and spastic. I certainly feel that Contagion paints the best picture of what would actually happen should a serious outbreak like this occur. This, of course, makes it all the more frightening.\n\nContagion is certainly a film worth seeing. It takes a much different approach to a genre we thought we were so familiar with. Soderbergh's poignant direction and Scott Z. Burns' sharp script give this film a great atmosphere, and the incredible cast lineup makes it all the better. It is undeniably slow at points, but when you put in the context of a film of this quality it doesn't matter nearly as much. This is a great way to kick off the fall season for film.", "reviewTitle": "Very unique take on the viral outbreak subgenre", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2011-09-10", "titleId": "/title/tt1598778/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Ameliex", "userId": "/user/ur65887065/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6709772152713857, "id": "/title/tt1598778/userreviews/rw5539680", "interestingVotes": {"down": 11, "up": 43}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Oh dear, what to say about this movie.

It doesn't end happily ever after for all, and some of the people in positions of responsibility (eg at the CDC) put their family first. There are allusions to politicians misusing their position. There are scenes where people loot, trample others to get to the head of the queue for medicines, steal food, generally, some/many people behave badly. (And in contrast some behave well). So the movie explores the spectrum of human morality, and shows good men have flaws. This is much closer to reality than the behavior that many movies usually reflect.

With loads of famous names involved, a director I like and a sobering subject, I had decent hopes for it to be at least worth seeing and I knew it wasn't going to be an Outbreak style thriller with against the clock races to catch a monkey or a helicopter standoff against a military bomber. As a result I was reasonably prepared for the film and not put off by how matter-of-fact it was in its delivery. Staying mostly away from hyperbole and false dramatics, the film takes us through the spread of the virus across the world, with the challenge of containing, managing and responding to it.\n\nAlthough there is some emotion to be found in some specifics if you want it, and there is a certain horror to the scale and the numbers, mostly the film doesn't chill as it could and certainly doesn't have urgency to it \u2013 what it has instead is a coldness and procedural approach. Personally I liked this and felt it worked better than the other extreme of lots of wailing and famous actors getting melodramatic death sequences. The downside of it though is that it feels like reading a bullet point summary of what would happen over the 150 or so days; so we get the hesitant response, tick; we get the misinformation, tick; we get the lines for limited supplies, tick and so on. Like a bullet point list on a document, it does a great job of giving you the basics but none of it is expansive or has much depth as a drama and I can see why some viewers would have major problems with this \u2013 I did too but I took it as the side-effect of an approach that mostly worked.\n\nThe cast list is starry but nobody really hams it up and mostly everyone underplays as much as they can to good effect. At times having famous faces in tiny roles was a little distracting but mostly it worked and it totally avoided the sense of old celebrity pals hanging out together at having fun together \u2013 a feeling these celebrity heavy films often can have. I think some characters got too much time \u2013 in particular I felt that Law's blogger was given too large a chunk of the time considering his small role in the global situation \u2013 the guy who discovers a way to manufacture the virus is in the film for seconds (despite being played by Gould) but yet a blogger is front and center? Not sure why but it didn't really work. Soderbergh's direction is effective and nicely clinical, it makes the approach of the film and I enjoyed his handling of it.\n\nContagion is not a brilliant film by any means, nor is it the one to come to if you're expecting high octane thrills, but it is enjoyable in a very clinical cold way. It is like a bullet point summary of a global viral outbreak and of course that creates limitations in several regards, but it also creates a strength in doing what it does.", "reviewTitle": "The matter-of-fact delivery is both a strength and a weakness but mostly it works", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2012-01-16", "titleId": "/title/tt1598778/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Smells_Like_Cheese", "userId": "/user/ur1293485/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6004875929632252, "id": "/title/tt1598778/userreviews/rw2486252", "interestingVotes": {"down": 30, "up": 69}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Since 1918 there has been a paranoid fear of a plague spreading around the world once again. It's 2011, how would things be handled? If you're smart, you know how most of the world would handle it, most people would turn into animals while the rich would benefit off the death of others. Movies have been created the past few decades on plagues hitting again, The Stand (even if it's a miniseries), 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It's terrifying to think of, hard to grasp even. Contagion was made on a more realistic documentary type of movie on \"what if\u0085\" factors. With an all star cast, we find out how fear can spread faster than a virus and what would life be like if everything and everyone we touched could kill us.\n\nBeth goes to Hong Kong on a business trip to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory. While in Hong Kong, Beth visits a casino and plays a dice game with colleagues from the plant. Once the ceremony is complete, Beth flies back to her husband, Mitch. Later that night Beth collapses on the floor in what appears to be a seizure. Beth is rushed to a hospital for treatment and passes to an unknown cause. Dr. Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control leads an investigation into disease related deaths, all exhibiting similar symptoms. As the contagion spreads, hearings are set up to discuss possible solutions, airports within the state are shut down, and the national guard is deployed to Minneapolis to cordon off the city, set up treatment centers and provide general order. But as the disease proceeds to continue taking millions of lives, the question is not only how to be cured but to stop the contagion from spreading.\n\nNot to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but this movie makes me wonder if it's either trying to prepare us for something or spread propaganda. This weekend, I'm writing this review on September 9, 2011, is the 10 year anniversary of 9/11. My boyfriend and I were watching a documentary the other day and I told him how since that day, we have lived in a paranoid society of fear, somewhat good on the fact that we know we can't be ignorant forever otherwise we'll get bit hard or is it bad; where everything has been so horrible to the point where we can't enjoy anything. Germ-X sales are way high because people are so terrified of catching something. In a society where we are cleaner than ever but we are so panicked to catch a disease of some sort and I wonder because of our media if this causes the problem.\n\nI digress onto the movie. The cast is very exceptional, the main reason I went to see this was to see Kate Winslet, my favorite actress. The cast is an all star, though in some ways it could be a bit distracting as Matt Damon looked a little like Mark Wahlberg to me for some reason. But each actor did a great job holding their own and each one having a little sympathy as you hoped for the best in the film. Although I wanted to throw a fit for Gwenth Paltrow's character spreading the disease to Chicago first, thank you very much! The style of the movie is done very well. I have only 2 complaints, one being that the film could have been a little more shocking, since we are thrown right into the disease spreading, it's hard to latch onto any character because we know there's a chance of them dying. The tension could have been a little more there. The ending was also a little off, thought this is a mild complaint as I would see this like how it fizzled out just like if this was for real, if the human race had fizzled out. But it left me a little unsatisfied; I wanted more at the end. I think I would recommend this as a rental or a matin\u00e9e for those who want an intelligent film. It does keep you frightened on some level making you wonder if you could be next in a plague that will kill millions of people.\n\n8/10", "reviewTitle": "Like a tea kettle, it starts hissing, then steams and whistles like crazy, then dies down", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2011-09-09", "titleId": "/title/tt1598778/"}], "totalReviews": 581}, "tt8629748": {"@type": "imdb.api.userreviews.userreviewsfortitle", "base": {"id": "/title/tt8629748/", "image": {"height": 2222, "id": "/title/tt8629748/images/rm630818561", "url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdkOTEwYjMtNDA1YS00YzVlLTg0NWUtMmQzNDZhYWUxZmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "width": 1500}, "title": "Spenser Confidential", "titleType": "movie", "year": 2020}, "paginationKey": "g4wp7cbnquztezqb7othrojzrdq4mar7y4hhzo5ziwr26fbyhvrl4ty4ou2f5nrccvwndtswzroqho554avhgco2h7aqrfnj", "reviews": [{"author": {"displayName": "heulnicht", "userId": "/user/ur81298076/"}, "authorRating": 6, "helpfulnessScore": 0.778729133068165, "id": "/title/tt8629748/userreviews/rw5530858", "interestingVotes": {"down": 37, "up": 185}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Typical Mark Wahlberg flick with likeable actors.

Spenser (Mark Wahlberg), an honest, hard-headed ex-cop with a strong moral compass gets out of prison, reconnects with his mentor Henry (Alan Arkin) and his new roommate Hawk (Winston Duke), a no-nonsense MMA fighter with heart. Spenser got in prison for trying out some vigilante justice & that is exactly what he's going to do for the entirety of the movie, just now with his new friend Hawk. The story is as old as the world and nor Peter Berg nor the screenwriter Brian Helgeland (who really can do better than this) has done anything much to spice it up. \"Spenser Confidential\" has comedy, action, sentimentalism and all the basic, vital ingredients, none of which rise above the level of average. It's kinda like the movie's sort of 'muted', like softened up, watered down, muddled, call it what You want. You've seen and felt all of this before, probably a load of times.

The act gives the object significance in the mind of the audience. Spenser Confidential hangs Chekhov's guns all over the place, but doesn't get around to firing many of them. Two central characters devote considerable time and discourse to career goals that are never realized, although they use related skills. A character is seriously wounded on multiple occasions, but seems unaffected. An unofficial private investigator accesses surveillance video, but the police never seem to bother.\n\nLike many contemporary films, the movie strives for political correctitude, often neglecting plot and character development to devote attention to social issues. An act of domestic violence is shown multiple times in flashback scenes, but seems extraneous to the plot. The cast is culturally diverse to a fault. The female love interests are maternal, age appropriate, and always fully dressed, even during a sex scene.\n\nYet the filmmakers seem ambivalent about liberal narratives. The villains are generally Hispanic or black, with the exception of some Aryan types who are pussycats by comparison. The protagonists employ enhanced interrogation techniques and sexual victimization to extort confessions. An investigative journalist is a staunch defenders of the truth, while television journalists mindlessly parrot false accusations. A dog lover is attacked by a vicious dog.\n\nThe plot is paper-thin, with reversals announced well in advance. The only surprises come when characters behave in ways that make little sense.

The Governour had charisma, style, and above all, a real reason for all his experiments; his daughter. We still don't know why or how Negan came to be.\n\nSeason 6 was full of chest-pounding and inevitably doomed plotting by the heroes, but it was still fun to watch them descend into mass murder.

They tried to show how he controls his people with rules and by burning them and so on, but overall it was a super tame story with \"Soon(TM)\" all over it.\n\nInstead of fixing that in season 8, they now bury the show in one action episode after another. And its not the somewhat smart action we saw in earlier seasons, but 80's style A-Team nonsense action. Cars are bullet sponges, ammo is thrown around like its World War II, a .50 caliber machine gun mows down 50 people with ease but can't hit one dude in a Jeep, and there is no stopping to all the shooting. Even when people are having a quiet moment to talk, you hear often hear shooting in the background.\n\nWe rarely have those epic Daryl moments anymore, Rick has become a a hollow shell of a leader, Carl seems to be on vacation.

I LOVE zombie movies. Dawn of The Dead is my favorite. Back in the early 2000 there were several great zombie movies. Nowadays they are awful. More guns, empty characters, and explosions plus bad scripts than anything else. How in the world TWD transformed into a Steven Seagal movie? I remember the beginning was so thrilling \u0085 suspenses, a story, characters that you cared about, scary zombies. But after season 3 or 4 everything turned into guns and people fighting people. Cheap scripts, retarded dialogues, poor CGI. Take any episode from season 4 on and you can broadcast it on a cheap TV station as \"action\" movie. No one would tell the difference.\n\nRight now you cannot care about any character. Bad actors that play as much as the trees in the background die by the dozen by each episode. Flashbacks and \"emotional\" (dumb) dialogues want to make us care about someone. But you can't. Zombies do not matter anymore, only rarely when they suddenly matter. It is either this image of them as \"pests\" most of the time, or lethal killers out of a sudden. I am sick of watching a cheap action movie that has nothing to do with a zombie movie. A zombie movie was a zombie movie because of the thriller surrounding this worldwide catastrophe of people turning into these creepy and horror things. That was the MAIN factor. TWD has nothing to do with that anymore.\n\nIf TWD would have kept 4-5 main characters and presented their struggle to live in this horror world full of zombies, then that could have been a great series. But even that has to stop. The only reason TWD continues is money. That's all. They make more money off the show. Why do you think the action happens in forests and zombies are mainly seen in packs from distance? Because it is cheap. No need to pay for shooting in a town and pay for complex CGI, a forest is perfect.\n\nSo. I loved this series but now I think it is the cheapest garbage out there. Honestly I don't care what happens anymore so I'll finally give up. Last episode \"Some Guy\" did it for me. I just could not bare anymore. I don't care who dies, who lives, because there is no story, no character, nothing intelligent about this series, nothing to watch. \n\nGarbage.", "reviewTitle": "From Zombies and horror to Steven Seagal and guns.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2017-11-18", "titleId": "/title/tt1520211/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "stevenrotherforth", "userId": "/user/ur34973289/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6402782844693568, "id": "/title/tt1520211/userreviews/rw3846780", "interestingVotes": {"down": 82, "up": 189}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "The Walking Dead\n\nI think the title of this review sums up TWD pretty accurately. What started out as a decent prospect then worked its way up through the ranks to become TV show champion of the world. But the last few seasons for me became slow, predictable and lacked the punch that the earlier seasons would week after week knock you out with. Like an aging boxer this show doesn't really know where to go and what to do anymore. So it keeps trying to do what it did in its youth but to lesser effect. Is it time to hang up those gloves?\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with the story TWD is about a group of people trying survive a zombie apocalypse. What becomes apparent is that you should fear the dead but fear the living even more. It's dog eat dog, or in most cases human eating human. Survival of the fittest. While the show started out very promising and over its eight seasons developed a bunch of characters that you will truly begin to care for, the show seems to have lost its way and has become almost as clumsy as the dithering dead that walk the Earth. During the shows entire run ( I'm currently watching season eight as I write this) there has been some truly magnificent television. Some great storytelling, nail biting, riveting moments that shocked.\n\nCharacters come and go and the long run time of each season helps us get to know each character thoroughly. They became almost like family members. So when one of them does meet their demise it's upsetting. There's been some great villains and foes along the way too. The Governor and Negan being most memorable. Negan played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan being probably the best thing about the more recent seasons. There's characters that have conflicting views. Shane played by Jon Bernthal being a good example. This show tugs on all the emotions. There's pain, anger, fear and despair. There's also the well timed piece of humour here and there to show that despite all that has happened to them these people are still human.\n\nThe production value of this show is of very high quality. Only the odd piece of CGI occasionally lets the side down. Particularly the CGI flames used instead of practical effects. This is odd as the practical and makeup effects in this show are second only to Game of Thrones. Prosthetic makeup effects are Oscar worthy. Can a TV show get an Oscar? I don't know but if it can this show definitely should. Zombies are brought to life, if that makes any sense by some truly wonderful makeup design. Animatronics are very realistic giving the whole show a level of authenticity usually associated with a high budget Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nA criticism I do have is that the show doesn't look and sound as good as it should. As a High definition experience the picture is often grainy with no vibrancy. Maybe this is intentional to show the grubby broken down world that the show is set in. Sound doesn't seem to immerse as well as it should. While I'll admit that it isn't bad it just doesn't sound as involving as some other big budget TV shows. Overall TWD is a superb show. One that will go down as a classic. It may have fallen slightly from grace over the latter years but it still remains a 10/10 experience and one that you should definitely check out.", "reviewTitle": "You wouldn't judge a boxers entire career on his last two fights", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2017-11-01", "titleId": "/title/tt1520211/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "kmi58746", "userId": "/user/ur34414654/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.640240397509312, "id": "/title/tt1520211/userreviews/rw5189759", "interestingVotes": {"down": 37, "up": 96}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This show should have followed rick on the chopper.it's where this show needs to go.

It's hard to have a real story line in this kind of movies because there are only so many possibilities. But the amount of drama introduced in this series , I would rather call it 'zombie drama'.\n\nIt's nice to see how the characters mature around an existing doomsday ecosystem. However - there are a few logical mistakes here that any zombie survivors would learn quickly.\n\n1) they seem to have no contingency plans whatsoever. Every time zombies make dramatic entrance and people scramble for things and/or start screaming. 2) they make no modifications to vehicles. The first thing anyone would do is to have reinforced vehicles - protrusions in front of the vehicle and so on (refer to resident evil). Even the prison scene where there are zombie hoardes around and wirefences are the only ones that keep them alive - they do nothing. 3) they don't trust renewable energy - one of the thing to raid would be to an electric store and grab as many solar panels as possible. No. 4) somehow no one has addressed the 'human waste problem'. Everyone is living perfectly fine living indoors for months to come. 5) they killed off Shane - it was a great character to have used for revenge on Rick later. Big mistake. 6) over the top drama with Rick and Lori - don't get me started about this one.\n\nOverall it's very good so far , apart from the problems", "reviewTitle": "Protracted zombie action", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-03-10", "titleId": "/title/tt1520211/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "ebbewahlstrom", "userId": "/user/ur59030145/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6226422482681642, "id": "/title/tt1520211/userreviews/rw5559348", "interestingVotes": {"down": 1, "up": 10}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Okay so let's put Season 8 aside and review Season 9-10!

It seemed they had no more ideas on how to further progress the story so the writers were just like \"let's axe this character this week\" \"oh we can do this character the next week after.\" LOL. Literally wtf it seemed like they were throwing darts at a board blindfolded with cast member pictures and that's how they would decide who would die in the next episode. It really feels like the killing spree of characters came outta nowhere and seemed uncalled for, for the way the show was going.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. However, that being said I have to disagree with the reviewer.\n\nSo here are the reasons I like the show.\n\nFirst, character development, this is not usually a very big trait in the Zombie genre. If you only watched 3 episodes, this is a big part of what you watched. They take the time to give you a slight background of the characters, a chance for you to get to know them. For those of us that are big fans of the Zombie genre it gave us a chance to think \"Who would I be?\" in this situation.\n\nSecond, the story doesn't follow a straight line. This was a point of contention in the other review. I personally like the multiple story lines. It keeps things interesting and keeps it from becoming a boring show where I can foresee how everything is going to turn out. And before anyone says it\u0085YES I know this is based off a graphic novel. I haven't read it and will refrain from reading it for a while.\n\nThird, the zombies look and act pretty bad ass. The make up is done great, not a bunch of CGI which is so common in today's world. So anyway\u0085if you aren't a fan of the zombie genre to begin with then yeah, you probably aren't going to get why so many of us love the show. However, I think most fans of the genre will love this show. \n\nSo in closing, for those of us who love the genre, It's a weekly dose of zombie apocalypse. \n\nFor those that aren't fans of the genre, when the zombie apocalypse happens and you don't know what to do\u0085don't come crying to me and my friends\u0085you'll just slow us down.\n\nOn second thought\u0085you may come in handy in case we need to make a hasty retreat", "reviewTitle": "My honest perception", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2011-08-07", "titleId": "/title/tt1520211/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "szeregowieclucas", "userId": "/user/ur29585743/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5961362361831177, "id": "/title/tt1520211/userreviews/rw4061773", "interestingVotes": {"down": 213, "up": 372}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I use to be big fan of this show.

It hooks you from the first episode and keeps your interest right until the very last episode. The actors are young, but it feels like they've been doing that job for ages. I also like the way the story is told, switching from the interrogation scenes to the scenes which led to the murder. I also feel like this show deals with many difficult topics in an excellent way, things like islamophobia, homophobia, patriarchy and the great wide hole between the rich and the poor, like the characters actually try to find the way to overcome all these things.\n\nThere's only one thing I have a problem with, and that is Marina's character. I can't help feeling like she really is the one at fault for being murdered. Or, okay, maybe not being murdered, but for putting herself in danger. She just. Can't. Keep. Her mouth. Shut. She can't keep a secret. She ruined literally everybody's lives, and her own, beacuse of this. You don't just go and tell people you know who the blackmailer is. You don't just go and tell Carla you have her watch. It's just.... idiotic behaviour.\n\nSo, yeah, I have a bit of a problem with that part of the script. I feel like maybe the showmakers didn't know how else to introduce certain plot points so quickly other than having Marina (and also Samuel!) tell stuff that no normal person would. Maybe they were pressed for duration of the show and didn't have time to have characters find out about these things in other ways, like the identity of the blackmailers or the location of the watch or, anything else, like when Samuel screamed in front of the whole class that Marina was pregnant (WHAT EVEN!) or he just HAD to text about her HIV situation during class, knowing full well that he could get in trouble for using a mobile phone in class.

I was unsure about how this would work at first, but it turned out absolutely brilliant. In fact, this season gave me major Euphoria vibes with the music choices and the overall cinematography, as well. I really commend them on this. My main problem with season 1 and 2 were the superficiality of the characters and the story. They seemed unrealistic and insincere. Season 3, however, was loaded with depth and character development. The writing was splendid (at least the captions were). The season felt real, raw and heartfelt, and that is exactly what I wanted. Now, I know that not everybody liked the ending, but I thought it was great. Once again, it felt real. Not everything works out like we hope it to and we need to accept that. It explores the consequences of the characters' actions, and I really found it beautiful, particularly in the last episode, how much they all developed and put silly things behind them. Through all the pain, they still managed to find hope. I would be satisfied if the series ended here and no more seasons were made. It was a beautiful ending.

In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking \"damn, are we near the end already?\" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone.

She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with \"Knives Out\", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of \"Knives Out\" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.\n\nDaniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. \"Knives Out\" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed \"Star Wars\" geeks)", "reviewTitle": "Pimp My Agatha Christie!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-18", "titleId": "/title/tt8946378/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "hitsmenghwani", "userId": "/user/ur60715768/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6267683107553752, "id": "/title/tt8946378/userreviews/rw5306243", "interestingVotes": {"down": 123, "up": 256}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This is a movie one would not regret spending money on.

It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen.

The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.\n\nPersonally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director.

Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.\n\nOverall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.\n\nWhat is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.\n\nThe Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is.

I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let's just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.\n\nNow, the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta's shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn't ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn't he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.\n\nOverall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie.

Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.\n\nVerdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways.", "reviewTitle": "A fun little mystery with a slick pay off", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-11-29", "titleId": "/title/tt8946378/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "cli-13744", "userId": "/user/ur106225835/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4743178506745529, "id": "/title/tt8946378/userreviews/rw5234475", "interestingVotes": {"down": 457, "up": 469}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn't give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example.

What I got was a cookie cutter 'mystery' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours, rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.\n\nSPOILER TIME\n\nIn regards to acting, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans gave great performances. 0 complaints for the main 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Harlan and Marta's scenes. There are more than 3 members of the cast, of which I have complaints; Jamie Lee Curtis and Micheal Shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines, probably due to Rian Johnson's directing. Don Johnson was good, LaKeith Stanfield was not, others were mediocre or just less. Special Daniel Craig section. Daniel Daniel Daniel. What was that. The screenplay reads \"Blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life.\" That is not what I was forced to listen to. The accent was very distracting and I could only hope for a case of Stockholm syndrome that never came. His character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective, but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. If that didn't bother you then it would have been a good performance\n\nAs mentioned I was expecting more Edgar Wright-esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.\n\nOverall, the writing is very basic, being a typical murder mystery. I am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. Throughout the story, there were many setups with minimal or no payoff, e.g. shoe blood, where is Marta from (Harlan should have commented to Ransom during their fight where she is from). There were also too many inconsistencies, like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time, some people went up with a noise and down without because Rian Johnson forgot. For the final reveal; Marta must be especially talented to feel \"tincture and viscosity\" of vials, a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe, but she had made the choice already which solution to use, maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. Also, the shots for Fran's last words were different, where she said \"you did this\" in the scene and first flashback, but \"Hugh did this\" in the last. These 2 issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries, in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention, instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts. The suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. By looking at the cast you can see it's either Jamie Lee Curtis, Micheal Shannon or Chris Evans, personally I guessed Micheal Shannon due to his typecasting, but when I realised that all 3 of Harlan's children where the same character, with different jobs, it was then obviously the built up character named Ransom. Ransom. His name is Ransom.\n\nThis leads me to one of my main critiques: Unnecessary characters. Despite all 3 of Harlan's children being the same, the \"nazi kid\" served 1 purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character, the granddaughter, Katherine Langford served a whopping 2 purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. There were 2 cops and Blanc for some reason, of which the comedic policeman was not funny.\n\nLastly, too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise 'every time', Marta vomiting when she lies, the dogs choosing to like and dislike people, or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware (secret doors and prop knives)", "reviewTitle": "Would prefer a knife in me", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-01-01", "titleId": "/title/tt8946378/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "btoews", "userId": "/user/ur3400939/"}, "authorRating": 4, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4645633861970199, "id": "/title/tt8946378/userreviews/rw5292439", "interestingVotes": {"down": 128, "up": 141}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn.

Sadly, instead of \"the plot thickens\", it thins out unbearably...\n\nOverall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...\n\nA whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..\n\nSpoiler Alert...\n\nLet's tackle the minor annoyances first...\n\n1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...\n\nNo building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn't add up to murder...\n\nThis means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...\n\n2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...\n\nHere however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)\n\nIn fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...\n\nThis leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...\n\nShe didn't have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn't add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...\n\n3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?\n\nThis gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!\n\nThat's ridiculous and again feels forced/false...\n\n4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...\n\nFirstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn't be able to find one...\n\nSecondly, Walt is the 'boss' of a printing empire and it's unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...\n\nThirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...\n\nIs he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance? Wouldn't Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?\n\n5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn't that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...\n\nOk, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...\n\n6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he's not Captain America, surely wouldn't choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..\n\nWhat does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...\n\n7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...\n\nMarta explained that he will die in 10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...\n\nWouldn't a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?\n\n Many more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the 'interrogations'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn't around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta's shoe...\n\nToo many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...\n\nNow...\n\nLet's get to the parts that killed the movie/story...\n\n1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...\n\nExamples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?\n\n-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?\n\n-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn't mix up 'back' and 'back again'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...\n\nIf he's wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...\n\nThese plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...\n\n2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...\n\nSince Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn't have done it...\n\n3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...\n\nWhen Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...\n\nAnd obviously, Ransom couldn't have done that too...\n\n4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn't stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom's car, not a single person stopped her getting in...\n\nThis is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...\n\nIn conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall...", "reviewTitle": "Nice try but no cigars...", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-12-08", "titleId": "/title/tt8946378/"}], "totalReviews": 1646}, "tt2527338": {"@type": "imdb.api.userreviews.userreviewsfortitle", "base": {"id": "/title/tt2527338/", "image": {"height": 2048, "id": "/title/tt2527338/images/rm1361479681", "url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljNTQ5ODItZmQwMy00M2ExLTljOTQtZTVjNGE2NTg0NGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODkzNTgxMDg@._V1_.jpg", "width": 1383}, "title": "Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker", "titleType": "movie", "year": 2019}, "paginationKey": "g4wp7croqaydiyya72vxfmzvqlsm6abhzfmxvlnomwklyczuf43o6ss6omzfvpzmdj4k5ash57iui3m22wfdhu3y2blwqiy", "reviews": [{"author": {"displayName": "donald-haschel", "userId": "/user/ur112728161/"}, "authorRating": 2, "helpfulnessScore": 0.8181811975937774, "id": "/title/tt2527338/userreviews/rw5427918", "interestingVotes": {"down": 132, "up": 715}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "1- to save us from paying for mary Sues\n\n2- to save us from Hollywood's lack of creativity and laziness via sequels, prequels and franchises\n\n3- to deny JJ Abrams' ex-wife more settlement money", "reviewTitle": "And Now We Know Why Torrents Were Invented", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-22", "titleId": "/title/tt2527338/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "ing-markocana", "userId": "/user/ur21313877/"}, "authorRating": 3, "helpfulnessScore": 0.787031583936669, "id": "/title/tt2527338/userreviews/rw5372534", "interestingVotes": {"down": 37, "up": 194}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I recently saw a review on YouTube that made me think about this last Disney trilogy and I almost came to accept that maybe I was wrong and the story arc for Luke and Leia made sense.

I know it's pretty much impossible to consistently follow-up the train wreck of The Last Jedi, but is this really the best they could come up with?\n\nThis also might be the most inconsistent trilogy I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of movies. They didn't have a plan from the start, and it's super obvious just from watching these movies. JJ Abrams wrote The Force Awakens with no intention of finishing it, then Rian Johnson comes with The Last Jedi and selfishly says \"F epsiode 7\" and does his own edgelord thing. Not only ignoring JJ's setup, but ignoring all Star Wars lore in general. Now with Rise of Skywalker, we have JJ clapping back at Rian, making most of Last Jedi pointless. Movies in this trilogy constantly retconning each other, it's beyond than just a mess. Calling it a mess is a massive understatement. It's like JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson rap battling each other, except in movie making form, and a huge brand loved by millions is no time for an immature rap battle.\n\nThis movie's plot is bad rip-off of Empire Stikes Back and Return of the Jedi combined. Rey finds out she's Sidious' granddaughter, similar to how Luke found out he's Vader's son. The entire final battle is a rip-off Sidious throne room scene in Return of the Jedi, except with none of the heart, and even cringe in some parts. And they already ripped off that same scene in Last Jedi, LOL! How many times are they gunna rip-off the same scene? Do they not have any orginal ideas? They also have Death Star returning again, kinda. Except they now put Death Star weapons on smaller ships, but it's the same concept and makes no real difference, SMH! It also makes no sense, because there was a legit reason why the Death Star had to be that big in order to support a laser that strong to destroy entire planets. Why do these writers lack any tiny bit of creativity?\n\nI'm aware they say they stick to familiar things to play it safe, but that doesn't means they should copy and paste everything from old movies. Have orginal ideas, but still has the heart of Star Wars, and keeps consistent with previous movies, that's all they had to do, and obviously you can't please all fans, but if they did they, they would please the majority of fans, way more than they pleased with this non-sense trilogy. It feels like these movies are made from a committee, rather than a man or team with a real vision, and are true fans of Star Wars.\n\nThe action is also boring, bland, and forgettable. I'm willingly to forgive a bad or okay plot if the action is amazing, like John Wick for example, but this? No way. There isn't one decent light saber fight in this entire movie. The Rey and Kylo rain fight was the best in the movie, but still mediocre. I know Star Wars is more than just light saber fights, but every movie should have at least 1 iconic light saber fight, especially when there's no good plot to fall back on. Even the final space battle is bland, like a Transformers movie sequel battle.\n\nIt beyond boggles my mind how a billion-dollar franchise can be handled so poorly, and by one of the richest companies on Earth with almost unlimited resources. How are JJ Abarams and Rian Johnson such awful writers? How are they paid millions to do this? They should stick to only directing, and stay FAR AWAY from writing. I swear, I've seen way better and consistent writing from regular community college students. How did hacks like JJ and Rian gets so high up? I guess this is just further proof of, it's just about who you know and what connections you have, not actual talent.\n\nOverall, boring, convoluted, boring characters I don't care about, and very forgettable movie.

First I'll talk about what I liked.\n\nThe acting, the visuals, the effects, the amount of lightsaber screen time, racial diversity, and obviously John Williams' score, were outstanding.\n\nHere's what I didn't like:\n\n* George Lucas confirmed that Palpatine had died long before Disney, the whole purpose of the first 6 films was that Anakin Skywalker was to grow up and defeat the sith to restore balance, which he did. And then this movie reversed that entirely\n\n* No introductory entrance scene from Palpatine, it's just thrown into the opening crawl that he's still alive....\n\n* Rey has healing powers? RIP Qui Gonn and literally everyone that has died in Star Wars up until now\n\n* Speaking of healing powers, that exact kind of power is what Anakin had spent most his adult life trying to acquire, everything he's done is to obtain more power and knowledge of the dark side, and then boom Rey just has it all of a sudden.... Anakin turned his back on everything he was taught in an effort to acquire healing powers. Rey is just walking around healing basilisks like it's nothing. So you don't need to turn to the dark side and kill billions of people? Light side jedis can heal all along? Anakin got pranked! Why didn't Yoda and Mace have healing powers or even know of its possibility?\n\n* The convenience of the whole dagger thing really took me out of the movie, wait whats that dagger thing? 3-PO pls translate. \"it contains the coordinates of the exact place we are searching for!\" hmmmmm that was real freaking convenient wasn't it, also why did the dagger exist? Why would Palpatine make it and write exact coordinates on it?\n\n* Apparently all it takes to defeat Palpatine is to have two lightsabers instead of one? You don't need years of training or wisdom...?... if only Yoda/Mace had known\n\n* The fact that Palpatine was able to conceive means he was able to feel love at some point in his life........ did he have a love interest raise the kids? did he raise them? Rey would have been more interesting if she was a \"nobody\", the fact that she's a Palpatine just seems forced and lazy\n\n* Rey and Kylo have had absolutely no romantic chemistry ever, their relationship is shown as sibling-like. The kiss was awkward, and totally random. But it's Disney, so is anyone really surprised by that?\n\n* There was no reason for Leia and Kylo to die, why couldn't Rey just use her healing powers to stop it from happening?\n\n* The back and forth of thinking people are dead and then boom all of a sudden they're not dead was exhausting. Chewey is dead! Nope. C3PO is dead! Nope. Kylo is dead! Nope. Rey is dead! Nope. They keep reviving each other until one of them couldn't anymore.\n\n* A lightsaber is a sacred weapon only to be used by jedis in self defense. It's not a flashlight, it's not something you lend to your friend, and there were 2 more scenes of throwing them off of cliffs, did they learn nothing from TLJ? In the movie Kylo and Rey both threw their lightsabers to get rid of them because they didn't want to keep fighting or killing...... so basically admitting they don't have self control? What kind of jedi are they? A lightsaber is not a killing weapon, it's for self defense!\n\n* The Rey v. Palpatine scene was so boring. Palpatine gets his full strength back, lightnings a whole fleet, and then is defeated in like 7 seconds... by his own lightning.... again\n\n* Kylo turns good? Of course he does. There weren't a lot of obvious signs of struggle, and honestly that would have been a much better movie if it was just from his perspective, I wanted more Kylo, but he hardly had screen time and had a disappointingly little amount of lines\n\n* Why bring back Han, Leia, and Luke just to kill them all off? Having the beloved three back together again is what was going to make the new trilogy so special, but they never got to reunite\n\n* The Knights of Ren sucked! Just kind of hung around and then got killed by Pajama-boy Ben all at once in only seconds of fighting\n\n* W. T. F. was that final Lando scene? \"Where do you come from? Lets find out\"..... Ummm what exactly did you mean by that?\n\n* Palpatine has a new giant fleet? Why not just lightspeed something through all of them, because apparently you can do that now...\n\n* Episode 8: Leia sends out a signal to all the systems asking for help... literally no one shows up---Episode 9: Lando flies around to all the systems asking for help.... literally everyone shows up. Not an inconsistency I just thought it was humorous, haha!\n\n* What did Finn want to tell Rey? They ended the movie before they remembered to answer that. At this point JJ is probably just trolling us by leaving that unanswered\n\n* Kylo should have killed Palpatine, to at least be somewhat consistent with \"I will finish what you started\"\n\n* Where was Anakin? Did he forget how to force ghost himself? Obviously didn't care enough about the resistance. Show us Hayden!\n\n* Luke's lightsaber just duct taped back together and it's as good as new?\n\n* A lot of this movie's purpose had to do with Rey's identity. \"Be who you are, Rey\"... cut to the end of the movie... \"I'm Rey Skywalker.\" Nope! you literally just learned that you're a Palpatine, nice try though\n\n* Leia should have died in TLJ... the unused footage was kind of creepy\n\n* It's pretty obvious that the trilogy wasn't planned out, there is no comprehensive storyline. What the trilogy is about is still a mystery to me\n\n* The pace of the first 30 minutes was super rapid, and then didn't stay consistent, they just kind of pasted scenes together but who cares, it's cool if you have a lightsaber out, right?\n\n* Poe can't catch a break for the 3rd movie in a row, just for comic relief too\n\n* In my opinion the best thing about the trilogy and especially ROS was the force connection that Rey and Kylo had, what they were able to do (communicate remotely, transfer objects to help each other, feel what the other is feeling, etc) was really interesting and I loved it. All of that ruined by the stupid meaningless kiss.\n\nSurely there will be people that love this movie, and I will never understand how they can look past all the above mentioned.

I can still remember the loud applause of the crowd at the powerful scene where Darth Vader saves his son and throws the Emperor to his death. My dad stood up and cheered as did many others in the audience. As I got older and watched that entire trilogy (and later on, as a young adult, watching the prequels) I realized the overall theme of that franchise and the importance of that moment: A person's fall from grace because of the seduction of evil and their redemption through the light. It made the moment of Vader's/ Anakin's redemption at the end of ROTJ that much more powerful; the emperor was destroyed and Anakin fufilled his destiny as the chosen one.\n\nWell, that powerful theme of the original was destroyed by this one. Like others, I was somewhat disappointed by the Force Awakens and the Last Jedi. However, I didn't hate them, enjoyed them for the entertainment they were, and figured we judge a trilogy as a whole. Well, the judgement is in and Rise of Skywalker not only fails on it's own right, it brings down Disney's entire trilogy as the story didn't even continue of the themes of it's own sequel trilogy, nevermind the originals. Here are some of my issues, especially as it spits on the spirit of the originals and even prequels:\n\n1-The Emperor- We find out suddenly, within the first seconds of the \"opening crawl\" of the movie, and out of the blue, that the Emperor is alive. That erases the entire story line of the first six movies and erased the emotional impact of the end of ROTJ and Anakin's redemption I just spoke of. Ok, well, at least we can get a cool backstory of how the Emperor survived being thrown down a shaft of a soon exploded death star? Nope, not a one mention of how he survived other than the throw away line of \"unnatural abilities.\" And other characters in the movie don't seem shocked about his sudden return. It's just a simple, oh, Palpatine is alive....so anyway. Remember, he was the ultimate bad guy of the universe. The universe celebrated the end of an evil empire upon his death. It shows the poor writing, in the same way we never find out how Kylo got Vader's helmet or how Maz got Luke's light saber. The \"story for another time\" line gets even weaker if the trilogy comes and goes without the explanation or the story. And what did Finn want to tell Rey? I guess we don't need to know. But I do guess good writing doesn't matter as long as you have cool CGI special effects and \"woke\" characters.\n\n2- Rey being Palpatine's granddaughter. The whole theater laughed at the reveal. Yes, laughter. Not the gasps of the \"I am Your Father \" line of Empire. There should be laughter as this is just another example of poor writing. When did Palpatine have time for a child? I must have missed that in the prequel trilogy. If we do the math, he would have to have been the older man during his time as chancellor when his son was born. As simple as Rian Johnson's explanation in The Last Jedi was, \"your parents were nobodies\", I can even accept that over the Palpatine connection. Heck, at least that showed any average person can have force abilities.\n\n3-New force powers- No one studies them, but rather they just learn them out of the blue. Giving objects through the air. Lol A sudden ability to heal and bring back to life. Wow, Anakin sure could have used this to save Padme. Again, bad writing.\n\n4-The character of Rey-I like her character and she really could have been a strong female character for young girls to look up to in the same way Leia was in the original trilogy. However, they, in modern Hollywood fashion, had to go to the extreme and pander and make her a perfect character, more powerful than anyone in Star Wars history, without the need to train or have flaws. It's almost like they brought the dead Emperor back for the sole purpose of her being the one to kill him.\n\n5-Kylo's redemption. This was also handed too quickly. And the ending kiss with Rey, the theater laughed at this part as well. Kylo also spent three movies trying to talk to the spirit of his dead grandfather Vader...how powerful would it have been to have the Force ghost of Anakin appear and talk to him about his own errors and redemption. That could have really tied three trilogies together.\n\n5- The whole final battle- Horses running on star destroyers, Sith lightening into space, all destoyers lined up in a row for an easy target, I could go on about the mess of the whole ending. Or how about Palpatine sucking the life force out of Rey and Kylo. I mean, he should have just done that to Luke in ROTJ and moved on.\n\nI'm done with my perspective. I don't blame the actors, they only read the lines they are provided with. Given better writing, this could have been a great trilogy. You wonder if these people even \"got\" what the old movies were about? Even John Williams' amazing score couldn't save this one. Everyone is free to have their own opinion, but as for mine, this movie will not be judged well. This movie lacks the heart and soul of George Lucas, which is clearly missing. This is the first and only review I have ever written on imdb, which shows my disdain for what they did to this once great franchise.

Kristoff's only purpose in the film was to find a way to ask Anna a very serious question, Olaf had no other purpose or journey and while Elsa's journey was the saving grace, the film portrayed itself as if it had cut out 30 minutes of important back story and character decision making.

This story heavily centers around the importance of change, even if that means letting go. Throughout the film, I found myself dazzled with the quality and beauty of the visuals that the animation team laid out. The story, for me, felt a little flat, however. I think the writing team missed the mark when trying to achieve the same quirkiness from the original. With the more dramatic path the writers chose to take, also came more epic musical numbers and effects. Sure there were still plenty of humorous moments, but I personally felt myself longing for more.

Show, don't tell. And yet they have written songs dedicated to the fact that people get older, just in case anyone should be in doubt, even if it doesn't contribute any to the plot. What fairytales are concerned, Disney's movies have always been timeless. This time the story has a location in time, after photography was invented and was spreading through the world. Personal preferences, but I prefer it when fairytales are timeless and takes place in a pre-industrial society.\n\nAnd no, Norway has never had a pumpkin tradition during the various celebrations.\n\nWe are told the enchanted forest is \"far away, as north as we can go\", and yet every location in the movie appears to be just some miles apart.\n\nThe concept of water with memory will probably be good for business is you're a homeopath. The idea of a fifth elements that connects the other four has been used before; in the animated TV-show W.I.T.C.H., and the science fiction movie The Fifth Element.\n\nA little nitpicking; I get that salamanders often represents fire, and there is even a salamander called fire salamander. That species does not live in Norway, and if you go far enough north, there are zero salamanders. Not that the fire spirit in the movie behaved anything like a salamander. It was more like a lizard, including the licking of its eyes, which we often see in geckos. Most species don't have eyelids; instead their eyes are covered by transparent skin, which is why they have to use their tongue to keep them clean.\n\nTwice does the movie make fun of its predecessor; once when Olaf pretends to be Elsa, and once when she sees herself in the ice cave, where she is practically rejects her most famous song scene. There are many people out there which the first movie and that song means a lot for, and treating the scene like that, especially in the cave, is practically like a slap in their face.\n\nThere is also the absence of logic. Why did the tribe of Northuldra, which lives as hunters and gatherers, or nomads at best (when they are not limited by a magical mist) believe they needed a dam? How did it made the forest suffer? Why couldn't the earth giants destroy it on their own initiative? Why did it affect the magic? It is never explained.\n\nProducer Peter Del Vecho said Disney was very careful to show respect for the sami people, which is the ones that inspired the Northuldra tribe. Too bad they didn't bother to show any respect for the native Norwegians. Sami and Norwegians have both populated the land long before the Norwegian nation itself came into existence, thousands of years ago. The sami have kept much of their original lifestyle, but that doesn't mean that the ethnic Norwegians doesn't have their own history, culture, identity, traditions and roots. Just like all other Europeans in their own countries. There never were villages with a huge amount of non-western ethnicities. We never get an explanation what dark skinned people are doing there, so we are probably just supposed to roll with it. Because diversity, even in a time and place where it didn't exist. I expect Disney's upcoming movie Raya and the Last Dragon to have characters and villagers of all races, from Europeans to Africans. Well, not really, because the setting is Asian, and doing something like that would not be respectful. And did you notice any members of the Northuldra tribe that looked like they came from elsewhere? Then there is the old clich\u00e9 about the noble savages, for the lack of a better word; tribes that lives in complete harmony with nature. They are so wise, kind and just knows stuff, and are connected with the forces of nature. Unlike the cruel Norwegians in the movie, that are xenophobic, scared of magic, destroys nature, betray those who trust them and act like villains. It's not the first time in a Disney movie where Europeans act like that, for instance the Aryan stereotypical villains in Atlantis, but it is the firs time they are portrayed like that in their own country. Imagine if it was the other way around; it was the Northuldra tribe that did something like that to the people of Arendelle. Progress and engineering is bad and have a negative impact on nature. Living like noble savages makes you a good person and connects you with magic. That's the lesson we learn. Is there ever praise for those cultures who have built their own country from scratch? Maybe, as long as they are not of European descent. When a story is about two of more different cultures, and one of the cultures is what we associate with Europa, Disney have a bad habit of portraying the latter in a negative light, and take liberties like turning medieval settings into modern day rainbow coalitions.

The Long Island Serial Killer (aka LISK) still remains unknown to the Suffolk County police. There have been many suspects over the years. John Bittrolff was one of those accused in these murders. He was arrested, tried and convicted of three of the murders of Rita Tangredi, Colleen McNamee and Sandra Costilla. He is serving two life sentences plus an additional 25 years in Fishkill, NY. DNA that was found on these girl's bodies is what convicted him of these murders.\n\nJoseph Brewer was the last person to have seen Shannan Gilbert alive. He hired her as an escort from Craigslist on the night of her disappearance. Brewer said that shortly after Gilbert arrived at his residence, she began acting erratically and fled into the night. Gilbert was reportedly seen running through Oak Beach, pounding on the doors of homes in Brewer's neighborhood. Around this time, Gilbert called 9-1-1 saying that \"they were trying to kill her\". However, police did not find any evidence of wrongdoing, and Brewer was quickly cleared as a suspect.\n\nDr. Peter Hackett was one creepy dude in my opinion, and he lied to the police when he said he never made a phone call twice to Mari Gilbert when phone records showed that he did. Why lie about something like that, that could be easily identified? The marshy area where Shannan Gilbert's remains were found were behind Hackett's house and backyard. Mari Gilbert filed a wrongful death suit against Hackett in November 2012, claiming that he took Gilbert into his home that morning and administered drugs to her, facilitating her death. Later police revealed that Hackett had a history of inserting himself into, or exaggerating his role in, certain major events. Police also noted that Hackett's wife and two children were home on the night of Gilbert's disappearance. Police later ruled out Hackett as a suspect in the deaths of Gilbert and the other LISK victims.\n\nNow, one of the more interesting \"suspects\" was James Burke, the former Suffolk County Police Chief claimed he was connected to the Long Island murders. In November 2016, Burke had been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, along with three years of supervised release, for beating a man who stole a duffel bag filled with sex toys and pornography from his vehicle. Burke had pleaded guilty in February 2016 to charges of a civil rights violation and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Gilbert's attorney said in December that one escort claimed that she had had \"rough sex\" with Burke during an Oak Beach party. Burke was reported to have blocked an FBI probe of the LISK case during his time as police chief. He has never been cleared as a \"suspect.\"\n\nThe media has speculated about a profile of the killer, referred to by police as \"Joe C\" (unknown subject). According to the New York Times, it is most likely a white male in his mid-20s to mid-40s who is very familiar with the South Shore of Long Island and has access to burlap sacks, which he uses to hold the bodies for disposal. He may have a detailed knowledge of law enforcement techniques, and perhaps ties to law enforcement, which have thus far helped him avoid detection.\n\nShannan Gilbert's death was originally ruled as a drowning but due to the controversy about Gilbert's death, in September 2014, famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden agreed to conduct an independent autopsy of Gilbert's remains in hopes of determining a clear cause of death. Upon examination of Gilbert's remains, Baden found damage to her hyoid bone (the same bone in Jeffrey Epstein's case), suggesting that strangulation may have occurred. Baden also noted that her body was found face-up, which is not common for drowning victims. Despite this, her death is still officially listed by police as an accident.\n\nThe worse thing about these many deaths and bodies found was the lack of respond from the Suffolk County Police. Fourteen bodies were found and only 6 have been identified and because most of the victim minus the 24-month-old baby girl whose mother was identified as Jane Doe #3, were all prostitutes. Their bodies were dismembered and spread out along the south shore of Long Island because many had identifying marks such as scars from surgeries and tattoos. Because they lived a dangerous lifestyle their murders didn't matter to them and never took it seriously until Mari Gilbert came and made it important. She was unrelenting in her pursuit of justice for Shannan. Sadly, there are no happy endings in the Shannan and Mari Gilbert's stories. Mari was murdered by her youngest daughter Sarra, who suffered from schizophrenia and Shannan's murder remain unsolved.\n\nThe police didn't care enough to want to solve these brutal murders because they were prostitutes. I've seen enough real murder mysteries to know this is a pattern with most police. If a victim lived a dangerous lifestyle even runaways and were murdered, they probably deserved it and that just infuriates me.\n\nThis movie brings back all those horrors of the LISK into my mind. It was well acted by all involved but Amy Ryan was outstanding, and her performance brought out the quintessence of the real Mari Gilbert and her pursuit of justice for her oldest daughter Shannan. The actor who played Peter Haskell brought out his creepy vibe perfectly. He made my skin crawl just as the real man did.\n\nEXCELLENT movie and I give it 9 out of ten. I would love to see a miniseries on the Long Island Serial Killer in the hopes of families who could identify the remains of the remaining 8 bodies.", "reviewTitle": "This movie brings back all the horrors of the Long Island Serial Killer", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-14", "titleId": "/title/tt3111426/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "pkdyer6519", "userId": "/user/ur47021332/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7663044986760439, "id": "/title/tt3111426/userreviews/rw5548713", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 25}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Excellent Netflix film based on real events, I don't say that very often.

I wasn't aware of the story behind it and I wasn't aware that it was based on true events. The main thing you'll notice when watching this movie is that is has an agenda, and it pushes it very heavily - and I liked that because it was personal. When a film just picks an agenda and decides to shove it in your face, that's garbage. But that isn't what happened here. This movie has a reason to be anti-police based on the real-life happenings and it wants people to know that. I think it found a good balance between getting its point across and also making sure it didn't consume the movie.\n\nIf you asked people to list all the Oscar nominated actresses who appeared in 'The Office' I think a lot would forget to put Amy Ryan on their list. She is though and 'Lost Girls' is further proof that when she is given the material to work with she can act her backside off. Her performance means a lot to this movie because she is the driving force behind almost every scene. If she wasn't able to pull it off the movie would fail, simple as that. She is terrific.\n\nIf you don't know anything about the real-life events this is based on then this film works very well as a mystery-drama. If you do know about them then I would suggest you're still going to enjoy this film, just in a different way. Don't come in expecting action scenes and over-the-top drama thrown in for the sake of it. This is a low-key, understated film that just goes about its business and does so wonderfully well.

The annoying part was, I could see the bones of a truly wonderful film buried in the sloppy storytelling.\n\nThe performances across the board were fantastic, and it was nice seeing Thomasin McKenzie in a film after her incredible performance in Jojo Rabbit last year. I don't think she was as good in Lost Girls, but that's mainly down to how good she was in Jojo Rabbit, and not really a negative against this film.\n\nThe direction by Liz Garbus was also impressive, and it boasted some nice camera work. The cinematography was kept dark throughout, but that worked for the tone they were going for.\n\nI liked the story that Lost Girls was trying to tell, but the execution wasn't as strong as I would have liked it to be. The ending was completely predictable, and the pacing was off. Some parts felt rushed, whilst others dragged out for much longer than they needed to.\n\nI also didn't find any of the characters to be fleshed out all that much, and so it was hard to care about their story. Obviously, because this is based on real events, I wanted it to pan out a certain way, but they should have developed the characters more. This would have allowed me to have a deeper attachment to the outcome within the film itself. An extra twenty minutes would have probably benefitted the film, because it clocks in at under 90 minutes without credits.\n\nOverall, Lost Girls was a decent watch, but probably not one I will revisit again.\n\nSCORE: 63%", "reviewTitle": "Lost Girls - Movie Review", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-13", "titleId": "/title/tt3111426/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "nicholls905-280-546911", "userId": "/user/ur31064494/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7134050511208722, "id": "/title/tt3111426/userreviews/rw5547925", "interestingVotes": {"down": 5, "up": 31}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Firstly, this being a true crime storyline, it's refreshing for a character study.

The new Netflix film Lost Girls came out today and I have had a chance to watch it and this is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a girl get kidnapped, after the police botch the investigation her mother leads the charge to get justice for her daughter and others like her. Main Character Amy Ryan plays the main character in this film and she does a really good job in the film, her character has so much pain and you follow her through this journey as she tries to get answers about what happened to her daughter. Her character has some issues about her and she isn't the most likeable person in the world but you totally understand where she is coming from and you see just how difficult it is for her character to go through the tough circumstances. Supporting Characters Thomasin Mckenzie from Jojo Rabbit is in this film and she does a good job in her role, she is one of the other daughters in the film and it is interesting seeing the way that she deals with the dissappearance compared to her mother. Gabriel Byrne plays the policeman in charge of the case and his character goes through quite a bit in the film, he clearly wants to do things by the book but understands where Ryan's character is coming from. He questions everything in the film and it allows his character to develop throughout and be more interesting then your average policeman. Though I felt all the other characters weren't that interesting and felt that they weren't as powerful as these other characters and some even felt a bit cliche and unrealistic for a film based on true events. Story The story is pretty tough to watch, as you clearly see a one woman mission to try and get answers, you go with her on the journey and you want to see her get answers in this film. However, I felt the pay off wasn't there in the movie, I know this film is based on true events so you can't change the ending but that means maybe it wasn't a story that should have been adapted. Also on another note, this film spoils its plot in the first minute and it took me out of the film and the ending.\n\nScript The script has some really good dramatic dialogue, the biggest compliment I can give to it, is that it feels very real, it doesn't feel like something somebody wrote on a piece of paper. But I felt like the script didn't delve enough into certain aspects of the film and it leaves you wondering if there were certain aspects of the script that were cut out of the film.\n\nStyle The style of the film is very methodical in its pacing, it keeps you intrigued in what exactly is going to happen if you don't know the story and it made you support the protagonist in its quest. However, it is pretty slow, and I questioned what was the film trying to achieve and as mentioned the film either accidentally or on purpose basically gives away the ending in the first part of the film.\n\nOverall Overall this film has an important story from real life and the film itself is interesting to a certain extent but overall I just thought it was okay and there wasn't anything that stood out. If you are interested in seeing a real story with a good lead performance then this will be a decent watch but you don't need to rush to watch it.", "reviewTitle": "An Above Average film based on true events", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-13", "titleId": "/title/tt3111426/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "arose823", "userId": "/user/ur103423879/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.3798596957941125, "id": "/title/tt3111426/userreviews/rw5550843", "interestingVotes": {"down": 15, "up": 18}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "If you do your research you will find that most of what is portrayed in the movie is simply untrue.

Its amazing how everyone likes to point the finger at someone else. The mother wasn't perfect, and by the end of the film, she seemed to realize it, and said she would start with herself when it came to responsibility, which means she was finally looking for truth, but its hard to blame a woman that was trying to raise a child while still a child!\n\nIts amazing how cops like to degrade prostitutes, but ironically, prostitutes main customers are often cops! What does it say about people when they degrade prostitutes but have no issue have sex with them? It says they are projecting because they are clearly the sick ones because they take advantage of people who are suffering, sick, abused, and need help! Most prostitutes were molested and raped as children and young woman which is statistical fact! I am a clinical psychologist and know first hand how many women that are sex workers were raped or molested by their dad's and males in their family as CHILDREN! These women need help, and clearly the one in the film needed help, because she had a psychiatric disorder and was not right in her head!\n\nThe fact that the old man who she interviewed said she ran away when he said he called the cops to come help her says the cops were involved in this whole thing! If you noticed, when she walked into the Association center and they focused in on the group pictures of the cops suggests that the film makers, from their researching for the film, believe the coops were behind part of this, and probably used and had fun with these women while they kept them captive and eventually killed them. This was clearly not the work of ONE man but several, and the way the cops handled this, their clear cut desire to move on, the lost evidence and lack of care for obvious evidence, especially during this day and age, because this day and age all law enforcement know that everything is evidence, suggests that these cops helped kill this girl.\n\nThe reason this girls murderer was never found is because the cops were behind this and it was in a small town where a group of men, and possibly women, worked together to accomplish whatever sick and twisted desires they had! For all we know they could have had a secret society there and they used these sex workers as sex objects, sacrifices to Satan, or some very sick and twisted stuff, which is what the movie ever so subtly suggested!\n\nIf the cops didn't just brush this off and act like it wasn't a big deal then I wouldn't feel this way. The cops were so adamant about not searching for this girl and clearly did not want to find here suggests that they are complicit.

That's the conceit at the centre of Leigh Whannell's latest film, The Invisible Man, a nail-biting thriller that has more on its mind than providing simple thrills.\n\nStarring Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, a woman who is rendered helpless in the face of an invisible evil, Whannell spins H.G. Wells classic science fiction novel of the same name into a timely and provocative exploration of psychological abuse.\n\nHaving escaped from a controlling relationship, Cecilia's rehabilitation is cut short by the sudden intrusion of her ex who has figured out how to regain control over her life without anyone knowing: by becoming invisible.\n\nExpertly utilising sci-fi trappings to take gaslighting to a whole new extreme, the film depicts first-hand the anxieties faced by many modern-day survivors of abuse. As Cecilia stresses to those around her that her genius scientist ex has become invisible, we are left conflicted by knowing the truth of her words but also the understanding that, without hard evidence, it's hard to accept her story at face value.\n\nBy operating in that grey area, The Invisible Man proves the horror genre to be one of the most effective means to reflect modern day anxieties to mass audiences.\n\nThe trade-off, however, is that by focusing solely on Cecilia's plight, the films feels somewhat underexplained in terms of its villain. Certain actions of his seem straight up superhuman and, without an explanation, it feels as if some logical concessions have been made for dramatic purposes. Granted, to Whannell's credit, he wisely abides by the notion that leaving certain things up to the imagination is better than over explaining to the point of exhaustion.\n\nWhere so many would-be franchises have failed by focusing too much on setting up sequels, The Invisible Man plays squarely to its strength as a strong, character driven film. Whether it connects to an extended universe remains to be seen, but the film, much like its protagonist, feels much stronger standing on its own.", "reviewTitle": "A nail-biting thriller that has more on its mind than providing simple thrills.", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-02-26", "titleId": "/title/tt1051906/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Bertaut", "userId": "/user/ur0277234/"}, "authorRating": 4, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5189844436475199, "id": "/title/tt1051906/userreviews/rw5549610", "interestingVotes": {"down": 73, "up": 106}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "H.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Hollow Man (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, which focuses not on the male scientist but on a female victim of his, is a fascinating idea, creating the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next.\n\nThe film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman) who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.\n\nWritten and directed by Leigh Whannell, this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making - men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved.\n\nAesthetically, the film looks terrific, particularly Stefan Duscio's cinematography, into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.\n\nBefore talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution.\n\nFor one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this - one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels.\n\nHowever, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, Hollow Man has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but Hollow Man never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas The Invisible Man clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory d\u00e9nouement, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.\n\nAlthough The Invisible Man was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity.", "reviewTitle": "Starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-14", "titleId": "/title/tt1051906/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "hungry_nirupam", "userId": "/user/ur42174860/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5078729950431998, "id": "/title/tt1051906/userreviews/rw5510135", "interestingVotes": {"down": 108, "up": 143}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "First of all, let me start with how excited I was to see this movie. Luckily, I got to catch this in an advanced preview. And I will say this, the excitement, counting of days, posting on social media, all paid off.\n\nThis movie definitely scares you. It's not just jumpscares or loud noises, it's something psychological. From the first opening shot, you're immediately put inside Elisabeth Moss' character Cecilia's head. She is stuck in an abusive relationship and can't get out of it. The whole opening scene makes you uncomfortable as we see Cecilia trying to make her escape. This kind of tension is kept on throughout the film.\n\nAnother thing this film succeeds upon is the writing. The story progresses in a fast paced way which doesn't seem hurried. The 2hr runtime feels achieved. There's definitely more than one 'WTF' moment in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe score and the sound design definitely puts you in Cecilia's shoes as you struggle with her to point out where exactly the invisible man might be. The camera work is exquisite, I mean did we really doubt the director who brought us Upgrade? The action sequences definitely feel thrilling and the way it's shot makes you feel like you're living it.\n\nIn my book, Elisabeth Moss can do no wrong. Her acting here is definitely something to be noted. From her being hysterically scared to her fighting back, Moss sells it. She makes us root for her. Oliver Jackson Cohen, who plays her abusive husband has a small but really pivotal role and boy o boy he is scary. The rest of supporting cast is also really good. Overall, this is Moss' movie and she carries it with ease.\n\nThis year (so far) there hasn't been many horror movies that genuinely gave me anxiety or made me jump. So I am happy this film succeeded in doing both. Leigh Whanell is an amazing horror writer/director and proves that he can still give us a solid entertaining flick.\n\nThere's some solid moments of blood so gorehounds can rejoice.\n\nI thought about it a lot and I can't really think of anything that didn't work. Some of you might complain about the camera work and how it focuses on the actor's faces more than the action but to me that worked. I think that definitely sold the drama.\n\nAll and all this was a terrific film, really made the universal monster scary by mixing the monster with a relevant story.

You are pretty much taking her word for everything. And then when it comes to the boyfriend... what is it about him? You see yeah he can be manipulative but you barely see that. But then you see the main thing the movie is about... the invisible suit and what are they really made for? Who were they made for and how many of those suits did he really have?\n\nThen on top of that when you're learning about the boyfriend you learn that he is supposed to be on top of everything. Very observant . And knows what is going on in his place. And especially when it comes to those suits he would know how many he has and what's going on with them.

Nope.

Despite living a life of wealth and privilege in a seaside home; she is ready to take drastic steps in her life. Cecilia is trying to escape from her controlling and abusive husband who despite being considered a wealthy genius in the field of Optics; has made her life a living hell and forces her to make a daring escape that has her barely getting away with the help of her sister Alice (Harriett Dyer). The film picks up two weeks later where Cecilia is hiding with a friend of her sister Officer James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia is scared to even leave the house and do simple tasks such as checking the mailbox and is livid when her sister comes to visit as she is sure that her husband will find her by tracking her Sister. Alice informs Cecilia that her husband has killed himself and she is now free to live without fear. Cecilia gets a letter informing her that she is to receive 100K a month to the sum of five million dollars as part of her husband's will. The fact that nobody should have her mailing address does seem odd to her as does that fact that the estate is being handled by her ex's brother Tom (Michael Dorman). With her new wealth Cecilia gifts James and also sets up a school fund for Sydney and begins to emerge from her shell. It is around this time that unusual things begin to happen to her. A lost item from the night of her escape shows up and a mysterious kitchen fire starts. Cecelia also wakes up to find the covers off the bed and what appears to be something unseen standing on the blankets when she attempts to pull them up. When she expresses her concerns to James that her husband is alive and exacting revenge, both he and Tom ignore her and when things begin to escalate, Cecilia is the one who starts to look more and more unstable as the tormenting continues and her life spins out of control.\n\nThe film is Written and Directed by Leigh Whannell who rose to prominence as one of the co-creators of the \"SAW\" franchise. The film is the perfect example of how to do a film of this sort as it is very clever in how it is paced and allows for the suspense to build without relying on many of the standard Horror Film staples.\n\nThe film is also good about having things happen before it pulls back so it is not an extended series of intense moments but several incidents between the tension and setup.\n\nThe cast is very good and what is amazing is that the film was made for a $7 million dollar budget yet looks every bit of a major studio film.\n\nThere are some interesting twists along the way as while I was able to predict two of them; the others were a very nice surprise. It is so refreshing to see a film like this come along as in many ways it can help redefine the Horror genre and proves that you can make a quality movie that is also scary and intense.\n\nI for one hope we see more from this franchise in the near future.\n\n4.5 stars out of 5.", "reviewTitle": "A Genre Defining Example Of Making A Quality Horror Film", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-02-27", "titleId": "/title/tt1051906/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "wrenchmebollix", "userId": "/user/ur46283333/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4414563523525167, "id": "/title/tt1051906/userreviews/rw5516526", "interestingVotes": {"down": 129, "up": 130}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I gritted my teeth the whole way through this. Being unfamiliar with the lead actress I had no frame of reference. However after nearly 2 hours of her 10 foot high head gurning at me I was traumatised. I genuinely don't understand the reviews for her acting. Like I say I have no idea who she is but good God. Apart from her character's unbelievable stupidity and awkwardness, I couldn't understand the relationship between her and her controlling husband. We were just told everything. There was no discovery. From her well-planned escape that basically consisted of her being completely unprepared, changing her clothes in the house, completely forgetting she had an enormous dog, the awkwardness of her bumping into things no one at the rendezvous, I was driven mental within the first 10 minutes. There was no descent into madness. The audience could have been given one iota of respect and offered the possibility that there was in fact no invisible man. Instead there was screaming and shouting and blubbering. Right up to the very end I got no sense of being drawn into any real story. For me the massive carbuncle in the plot was the finding of the second suit and her hiding it in the place that he actually found her. Surely he must have noticed that it was missing? I mean it was a massive suit and the only place that she could have hidden it was where she was eh, hiding. Let's forget about the fight in the corridor where she was literally lying beside a gun screaming and neglected to pick it up.\n\nIn conclusion I avoided trailers for this. I was assured by several outstanding reviews that this was fabulous and terrifying. It was neither. The reviewers were unfamiliar with true horror films probably because judging by some of the language I read, none of them had ever been to one. A final note.

Now the 1933 Invisible Man he killed at random and most of the time he killed people he didn't even know.

Now in the 1933 film the Invisible Man he was once a good kind gentle man who truly loved his girlfriend but the drugs he took to make himself invisible gradually drive him insane and transform him into a homicidal killer. And thus there is the tragedy of the 1933 character a once good man turned evil.\n\nAnd finally we come to last disappointment the means by which they achieve invisibility in the 2020 movie it is a suit which means anyone can put it on and become invisible or make copies of it and create a whole armies of invisible people.Also since it is a suit he can just take it off whenever he wants and be visible again. In the 1933 film it is a chemical formula that only he knows meaning he can be the only invisible one in the story and he as no way of becoming visible again in the movie he was trying to to cure his invisibility but eventually the madness from the drugs overtook him.

It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything.

Let's face it. It was a brilliant marketing strategy. In the wake of mass shootings, the release date of this film was delayed when its subject matter was deemed controversial, even scandalous The film's new marketing slogan became, \"The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one's actually seen.\" Of course, it wasn't really true, as very few were actually talking about it. But that's what made it genius marketing ... they created interest amidst controversy that has since proven unnecessary. Director Craig Zobel (Z FOR ZACHARIAH, 2015) has delivered the least controversial, non-polarizing film of the year. It basically laughs at extremes on the left and right, and reminds us how laughing at something can often take away its power. And regardless of your \"side\", you'll find some laughs here.\n\nIf you've seen the trailer, you know that the premise has a group of liberal elites hunting a hand-selected group of social media-active MAGA deplorables. It's a twist on Richard Connell's 1924 short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\", although the modern day rich aren't hunting for sport, but rather for political affiliation - gun lovers and climate change deniers. That may sound politically charged, but in fact, it plays as more comedy than comeuppance. Sure, the violence is over-the-top and often quite graphic, but this is a skewering of both red and blue.\n\nPreventing the project from falling into B-movie muck is a standout performance from Betty Gilpin (\"Glow\") as Crystal. She's a Rambo-type who speaks (with a southern drawl) only when necessary, and seems to have learned a lot while serving in Afghanistan. Most of the time she looks like she has \"a pinch between her cheek and gum\" (a tip of the Stetson to Walt Garrison), and she also hums to herself and tosses down some unusual facial expressions. This is a seriously oddball performance that is the film's highlight.\n\nOne of the best sequences of the film comes quite early as the dozen or so 'deplorables' slowly wake-up and find themselves gagged in a field. A container of weapons leads to an early massacre that allows the filmmaker to tease us with numerous familiar faces taking turns as the heir-apparent lead. Some of the faces that pop up include Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Christopher Berry, Sturgill Simpson, Kate Nowlin, Amy Madigan, Reed Birney, Glenn Howerton, Hannah Alline (flight attendant), and Usman Ally.\n\nOf course we know this is headed to a showdown between Crystal and Athena (2-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank), the ringleader of the hunting party. A fight scene reminiscent of the KILL BILL movies (sans Samurai swords) takes place at Athena's \"manor\", and it is stunningly staged and executed. Unfortunately this scene also highlights the mostly inadequate dialogue that exists throughout the film. Some of the quips click, but many fall flat - surprising since the co-writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof have previously collaborated on \"Watchmen\" and \"The Leftovers.\"\n\nBlumhouse Productions keeps cranking out these offbeat genre films, and this one likely benefits from a misplaced scandal, and it strives for self-importance by comparing itself to George Orwell's \"Animal House\" and with an obscure reference to TEARS OF THE SUN (2013). It's not at the level of last year's gem READY OR NOT, and it missed the opportunity to make some political points, but it's a hoot to watch and as an added bonus, Hilary Swank teaches us the proper way to make a grilled cheese sandwich!", "reviewTitle": "it's a wild one for both extremes", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-12", "titleId": "/title/tt8244784/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "jaywensley2004", "userId": "/user/ur46519349/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4386609703511911, "id": "/title/tt8244784/userreviews/rw5547060", "interestingVotes": {"down": 65, "up": 71}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Oh boy this is fun.\n\n\"The Hunt\" had preview screenings tonight, and I am SO glad I went to one. I have not been this entertained by a movie in a long time.\n\nOriginally scheduled for release late last year, due to media spin about a movie most of the complainers hadn't seen, Blumhouse Productions delayed the release, while they waged a quiet counter-campaign.\n\nThey were right, to do so. This movie IS NOT what the hue-and-cry suggested it is. To be sure, \"The Hunt\"is about political leftists hunting political conservatives (aka: \"Deplorables\") for sport, but this is satire; tightly scripted, brilliantly executed, and with every trace of polemics themselves lampooned for dark...very dark...laughs.\n\n\"The Hunt\" is above all funny. If you have the sense of humor for it. It is also grisly; filled with flying body parts and graphic violence worthy of the horror movies Blumhouse is rapidly becoming famous for. But all of that is in service to political satire from which no point on the spectrum escapes unsoiled.\n\nBest of all is the direction. Delightful twist follows carefully delivered surprise again and again. And just when I though I had the algorithm figured out, Director Craig Zobel gently pulls the rug, and I laugh at myself for thinking I could anticipate any of it.\n\n\"The Hunt\" is rated \"R\", and it earns it. As I said, the violence is graphic and real. The language is as legitimate as angry people arguing for their lives, and their beliefs.\n\nI would not say that the movie gains any special benefit from being seen in a theater, but I have a feeling this film is going to be a HUGE hit, and if you wait for a home release, you may experience people spoiling it for you. At the very least, you will be an outsider, listening to people rave about \"The Hunt\".\n\nI give it nine stars.\n\nNine very shiny stars.", "reviewTitle": "The pig in the poster is named Orwell.

The film I'd most compare it too is \"Cabin in The Woods\" - as it takes a similarly well worn premise and manages to do some different and new things with it. However, \"The Hunt\" doesn't have \"Cabin's\" rewatchability. Once you know the plot, I can't really see another reason to come back to it.\n\nI'd also say, the trailer for the film really does the movie a disservice, as it gives away a couple of the films secrets, including revealing who the lead \"Liberal\" is played by - which the movie goes to great lengths to keep concealed. The deaths are nicely done though, and often come out of nowhere, with a wonderful practical feel to the effects and it's a funny film, occasionally laugh out loud so.

There's little to no intrigue, it all feels too similar to other stories - some is even given away in the intro video. It almost feels like everything this is trying to be has been done better with the same context in other films and series.\n\nIts not funny, even when it is trying to be - it is not intimidating, when it is trying to be. The opening scene of the first episode has a great antagonist that is later completely made into a farce for reason that I can't fully understand from the story's perspective. It does occasionally dabble in horrifying subjects when it deals with characters' past.\n\nAlas the main cast falls flat, while many of the supporting crew does a great job - with the given dialogue. Al Pacino is wasted playing a caricature with unoriginal story, again, even when he's trying to be interesting - it is Al Pacino with an accent.\n\nVerisimilitude went out the window when the main character - a young adult or late teenager - goes superhero after the death of relative without any portrayed conviction. Nowhere is it established that the main protagonist is any good at what he seems to be able to do as a savant and that feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nIt takes away tension as well, since it seems unbelievable for the main character to have any interest in his world other than the obvious - loss of a family member. Any situation he's put it ends with a witty remark, a curse or him doing something that is unbelievable or wasn't established anywhere he could do.\n\nSo the positives, it is well shot and made, scenes feel like they belong - 1984 feels like 1984. Flashbacks of some of the characters to different times are well shot and made and are the only scenes that had a lasting impact, the transition and editing of these scenes is fluid as the meager story is being told. The music is great, since it deals with several different time periods it does a good job of blending transitions.\n\nNo doubt in my mind some will view this series as political and while I think this series is a fantasy with real life elements and nothing else it far more important to remember that it doesn't challenge any notions we weren't already aware of or doesn't spark any thoughtful conversation like last year's Watchmen could. This series is far too light for it to have any meaningful political impact however, anyone who thinks it does is wasting their time talking to a wall.\n\nIt is not great, it is not terrible either.

In fact, the first episode of HBO's new series, adapted from Stephen King's 2018 novel, chronicles what appears to be the world's most open-and-shut case: Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman), a local coach and teacher, is fingered by a slew of witnesses, and his DNA is blanketed across the crime scene. FBI detective Ralph Anderson (Ben Mendelsohn), observing eerie footage of Terry staring down cameras on the night of the murder, ponders if he's \"begging us to catch him.\" He's not, though. Terry says he's innocent. And, as quick as it surfaced, the forensic evidence begins to contradict itself. Video footage, too. An unnerving question lingers: How can someone be in two places at the same time? HBO's choice to air these first two unrelentingly grim episodes back to back is a smart one-and not just because it's the perfect set-up for some clever, tension-easing joke about how director and star Jason Bateman can possibly be in two places at once. Novelist Richard Price, also no slouch in the TV department (The Wire, The Deuce, The Night Of), uses these two hours to drop in on that chain at several starting points, showing us how the careful gathering of evidence leads inexorably to an arrest that, based on what we're shown, is both inevitable and correct, and horribly wrong. Then he shows us all the things that go wrong next. Thankfully, Price and Bateman, the latter of whom helms the first two episodes, don't revel in the misery, with Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans' skeletal, string-forward score serving to frame and compartmentalize the show's fountains of grief. Their focus is on the peculiarities of the mystery and the procedural aspects of the investigation, which are unpacked with grace and clarity via interrogations and well-executed time jumps. Mendelsohn, too, is a steady centerpiece, confidently playing a flawed, emotionally broken lawman whose poker face perseveres even as his rage threatens to boil over. Fans of the genre will no doubt be enthralled, while others may long for a touch of levity.", "reviewTitle": "Bateman Rules..", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-01-14", "titleId": "/title/tt8550800/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Vaxi", "userId": "/user/ur41292581/"}, "authorRating": 6, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5484361754255018, "id": "/title/tt8550800/userreviews/rw5538951", "interestingVotes": {"down": 35, "up": 64}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "First of all, the story was great.

This is NOT Takeshi Kovacs! Anthony Mackie has a revelation here - he does not have a very good range. Since Joel Kinnaman is the previous Takeshi, he should have studied and followed his style more. His Takeshi is TIRED and utilitarian, with a disembodied stare that almost watches it's own body move and breath. Mackie's Takeshi shows far too much emotion, far too much eyebrow acting. Kinnaman's Takeshi has the slack, the grit and swagger of an exhausted warrior with relaxed habits that he seems to have done things countless times before. Mackie, even after his Marvel films, has no grace, his posture is always stiff, arms are always to his sides and his neck is too stiff, as if he's thinking so hard about the script. Kinnaman knows how to sway them around, to make a dynamic, almost drunken stance, and he can control his neck and head to react to certain scenarios and emotions.\n\nI'm not even bothered by the difference between Kinnaman and Lee, because Lee's was a younger pre-Envoy version, and in the previous season he was mostly a flashback.\n\nAnd this world... is so bland and one-dimensional, it's as if it's a 2-second brain fart. No culture, no depth, no nothing. You wouldn't love the planet, you wouldn't hate it, and you definitely wouldn't care about it, after all - it's a flat drawing. It's like the groundbreaking idea is... 'oh let's put them on a different planet, and the place is a future city with rich and poor people' That's it?!\n\nSeason 2 has no flavor, no dark humor, no depth and no life. It's a plot you've seen countless times, with a script so bland and boring a highschooler could have written it. I couldn't even call Season 2 cyberpunk, it's just... 'a high tech soap'. Remember the scene when Takeshi murders all those scientists and random people and grabs his girly UNICORN backpack close - and hilariously hangs on to this random guy's severed head. There's none of that here, it's all just bangbang-talk-iloveyouforever-talk-bangbang.

Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.\n\nFor those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. \n\nThen there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.\n\nThe writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. \n\nAnd then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. \n\nTo sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about \"Better Call Saul\" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK.

I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.\n\nBreaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.\n\nI finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?\n\nBoy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.\n\nI'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later.

Sure, in it's nature, that's what the show is. But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.\n\nThe acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world. \n\nThe humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through. \n\nThe music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).\n\nGilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show. This widens the whole show's time-frame, instead of just being self-contained. The brief flash forward to the fragmented Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad was amazing. I really hope that the writers continue to play around with time, shifting between past and future guises of Saul Goodman.\n\nBetter Call Saul has a lot of promise to extend itself beyond its Breaking Bad spin-off status. The show feels individual, but also leaves enough Breaking Bad in there to keep us from leaving the world of Albuquerque that we have grown to love.", "reviewTitle": "Better Call Saul challenges 'spin-off' title", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2015-02-09", "titleId": "/title/tt3032476/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "bloob-67331", "userId": "/user/ur78048331/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6361870615810497, "id": "/title/tt3032476/userreviews/rw4474325", "interestingVotes": {"down": 44, "up": 109}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Better Call Saul might be my favorite show off all time because of three reasons, it is slow but never drags, it jumps between different genres without being inconstant and it has that Breaking Bad feel but it doesn't lean too much on it.

I have to say based on the 2 episodes that have aired so far I have to say it has not disappointed and if the show continues to be this good then I will have another perfect show in my watchlist.\n\nIt has been great to see Saul Goodman (Jimmy McGill as he is known here) back to his roots, here we see a very different version of the character as a down on his luck lawyer as opposed to the criminal lawyer who handed Jesse Pinkman bags of dollars without a care in the world, yet his charm and his cocky persona and sometimes hilarious one liners stay exactly where we want them. The tone also feels very different to breaking bad. We get to see a much more lighthearted approach to this series.\n\nWe also get glimpses of Mike Ermantraut (Jonathan Banks) which was great and whilst so far we haven't seen a lot of him i am certain we will get a lot more interaction between the two (he is second billed in the titles afterall). I was also surprised to see another fan favourite although i wont spoil this for those who don't know.\n\nAs the series goes on i will post about my opinions more but i feel this show is great and will continue to go up and be on par with Breaking Bad.

So when I finished binging it about 2 years ago, I started watching Better Call Saul immediately afterwards. Hoping to latch onto it as a way to keep Breaking Bad alive. In some ways, the show succeeds in doing that, but it is very much it's own thing too. Focusing on the story of how Saul Goodman came to be.\n\nTo be honest, spinoffs almost never work well. To give one example, The Walking Dead's spin-off, FTWD, was a decent show, that never lived up to its potential. That changed in season 4, as the reboot breathed new life into it, but the point remains, it started as a relative failure. I was nervous BCS would end up being the same, but was I wrong. Better Call Saul I find to be an actual good spinoff. This is rare. That being said, the show is still not of Breaking Bad quality. That is an unrealistic expectation, however, because spinoffs *never* live up to or exceed the original. Going back to my example of TWD and FTWD, or the Star Wars OT and the Sequel Trilogy, etc. This will even likely be the case for the MCU after Avengers 4. To get back on topic, even though it isn't equal to Breaking Bad, the show is still definitely worthwhile. If you loved Breaking Bad, you should at the very least be able to find something to like about this show.\n\nThe main problem I find with this series is the pacing. This is one of the slowest paced shows that I have ever watched. Slow pace is not always a bad thing, in fact I advocate for it because it gives us more time to connect with the characters, such as when it's used in the parent program, or TWD, etc. Better Call Saul lays it on a little too thick I feel. Sometimes, because of this slow pace, the show might feel a little aimless. If you can get past that, it tells a compelling story about the descent of a man. As well as offering interesting hints as to what happens to Saul after the events of Breaking Bad.\n\nBob Odenkirk portrays Jimmy McGill's descent to Saul Goodman spectacularly. It really is a treat to watch. All of the other main actors are great as well. And it's enjoyable to spot Breaking Bad Easter eggs, as well as to see characters from the show brought onto this one. Such as Mike, Gus, Hector, etc.\n\nOverall, BCS is a good show that can stand on its own. But it is made even better if you watch Breaking Bad first.\n\nMy Rating: 8.0/10", "reviewTitle": "The Descent of Jimmy McGill", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2018-10-08", "titleId": "/title/tt3032476/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "CajunGentleman", "userId": "/user/ur17252323/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4841818013179302, "id": "/title/tt3032476/userreviews/rw4352949", "interestingVotes": {"down": 14, "up": 25}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Reading the reviews on here (and looking at the helpful votes as well) it's very obvious that there's a slew of BB fans that are so emotionally attached to their favorite show (it's my favorite show too, but my emotional attachment is quite different) that they can't allow any prequel/sequel come anywhere close to it. Those are the ones writing the insanely hyper-critical reviews on here. They want BCS to match it in every aspect in order for it to receive more than 5 stars on. And it's absolutely absurd. This show is it's own show. It's not a carbon copy, and whoever said it should be was dumb. It stands on its own, as it deserves to... just like BB did during its time.\n\nCall it slow as much as you want, but those resorting to that adjective have little depth. Any scene, any shot... and song... anything shown to the viewer in this show is layered with meaning. That is why it's a beast. If you only want blood and action, fine. Go watch something else. But if you have depth and seek a show that delivers in meaningfully depicting characters struggling to adapt to their real life (in a way all of us can relate to) then this show won't fail. It's action is scarce in comparison to the stakes BB had most of the time. But in visual storytelling and relateability, this show exceeds BB in those respects, in my humble opinion. It's Gilligan and Gould, so what else do we expect. And to consider how amazing this show is as a prequel to probably the greatest show ever made (maybe the hardest task any show could have) it's an incredible feat. \n\nHopefully this review will inform potential viewers on whether it's a show for them. Cause I don't believe every show is for everyone. But also hopefully clarify why so many reviews on here are skewed one way or the other. I believe most people who are emotionally attached to BB are the ones taking the time to even write a review of BCS on IMDB, because fans like me who appreciate both for what they each are feel no need to. We just enjoy it, and assume everyone else will feel the same way. But after reading the many absurd takes on Better Call Saul here... I felt something needed to be said. This isn't a simple continuation of Breaking Bad. It's its own show, and kills at what it does. Whether you enjoy visual storytelling, character development, and provocative drama filled with common meaning we all can touch, that's really up to you.

BCS depicts several characters who all appear to have an inner life, fears, guilt, desires, things that really annoy them and which make them do what they do. And the characters change over time, misunderstand one another, and resent one another. As BCS continues, the illusion that you are witnessing the lives of people you know becomes even stronger. The very opposite of a melodrama, where the 'characters' behave predictably to type.\n\n2/. It's a prequel to 'Breaking Bad', considered one of the best mainstream TV series ever made; at least up there with 'The Wire' and 'The Sopranos'. What Peter Gould has managed to do is absolutely explain the backstory to tragedies we already know will happen in a thrilling and suspenseful way.\n\nHey, it isn't perfect all the time (how does Lalo know where Gus's dead drops are so as to tell Krazy8?), but I continue to give it 10s because unlike so many shows (and movies) in this, the Age Of Streaming, BCS doesn't ever insult my intelligence.\n\nThere will have been 63 episodes at the end of season 6.

Mike Ehrmentraut as the Health and Safety Officer from Hell is utterly hilarious, counterpoint to the morbidity and solemnity going on elsewhere with Chuck's suicide. And who doesn't want one of those buggies? B-rilliant.\n\nBCS is doing something that NOBODY else in TV is doing. Inventing real characters in a horrible - but plausible - situation, and being completely faithful to their natures, wherever it leads. That's why you might watch the credits and recognise all the actors as their names come up, instead of thinking they sound like US accountancy firms. This is the complete opposite of melodrama, which is what 96% of the other stuff does. Buy, beg, steal or borrow Better Call Saul because your grandchildren will want to know why you missed it, and will want your copy.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nJimmy McGill tries to do the right thing but it always goes wrong.\n\nHeard of Emile Zola and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac? 19th century French novelists who each wrote a series of novels that used the same characters from one novel to the next; in one they would be lead character, in another a support. Am I comparing BCS and Breaking Bad to classic French novels? Well yes; even the delivery format of modern 'cable' series is similar to the monthly publications of novels in the 1800s. Vince Gilligan and his team are certainly the front runners by far in the modern quality pop culture stakes. And in both BB and BCS, as with those writers, we have an uncompromising background of modern urban life.\n\nIt helps to have watched 'Breaking Bad' - in that series, the suspense was perfect; no-one knew what would happen, and no character apart from Walter White seemed indispensable - Jesse was to have been written out in series 1, after all. In 'Better Call Saul', you again have the teaser at the beginning, where Saul is flipping burgers in a shopping mall eaterie in Nebraska, paranoid about being recognised. If you've seen BB, you might suspect that this is only a partial teaser, Vince Gilligan setting you a trap. If you haven't, BCS looks like a flashback of 'how Jimmy McGill got to middle-aged mall misery', which probably doesn't provide the dramatic suspense that Walter White's cancer diagnosis did. But then, Breaking Bad started with a crazy Winniebago chase as well. Better Call Saul is more in the 'Chinatown' groove than Breaking Bad's surreality - so far.\n\nThat qualification aside, BCS is written, produced and performed to the same excellent standard of Breaking Bad, and Bob Odenkirk has no complaints from me on the acting chops. His is a sad, solitary character, his only foils being his sick brother Chuck, and Jonathan Banks as the parking attendant from Middle Earth, so you don't get the crackling dynamic that Walter and Jesse had.\n\nBut it's early days, I'm on Ep03 and if there's one thing you can count on, it's that Vince Gilligan will play with and exceed your expectations. It's not whether it's 'as good' or 'better' than BB. It's just as good. It's just that the lead character is less sympathetic, and doesn't have as far to go. Or does he?\n\n\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n\nAnd so, a year or so later, we're into season II. I feel sorry for those who have not learned to trust Vince G. and Peter G.'s storytelling, and are therefore bored by the mental work involved in enjoying BCS.\n\nDon't you see, people? Slippin' Jimmy's 'proper' lawyer brother styles himself as the supremely professional, ethical one, but he stitches up his (caring, earnest) brother with the callousness of a Roman emperor - JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE DO.\n\nJimmy's girlfriend depends on him to make life interesting, but expects him to remain in control of the chaos he creates - JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE DO.\n\nMike the enforcer wants to be a genial grandpa, but gets his beloved granddaughter to help him make a 'stinger' to stop a drug truck that directly results in the death of a good Samaritan, while telling his dead son's wife that it's a soaker for the rhododendrons - JUST LIKE - you get it.\n\nOh, the nuances. If you're missing them, you would benefit from an introductory course in scriptwriting. Better Call Saul is streets ahead of anything else and will be savoured and appreciated long into the future. It's so good, it makes the awesome, revolutionary, phenomenal 'Breaking Bad' look like a soap opera.\n\nThe TV equivalent of Shakespeare + Tolstoy + Dostoyevsky at their best. \"Your review contains a very long word which is not allowed\". I take that as a compliment.

After being tricked by his brother at the end of last season Jimmy McGill is forced onto the defensive to protect his future as a lawyer. Meanwhile, Mike finds himself in the middle of a turf war between two drug kingpins. Main Character Bob Odenkirk is back as Jimmy McGill and I thought this season might have been his best work yet in the show. You can see throughout this season by some of the actions he decides on he is getting closer to becoming the true Saul Goodman that we saw on Breaking Bad. But he also has more compassion then Goodman which shows that he is still trying to do the right thing even though it sometimes doesn't work out for him. His character is full of shades of grey but overall you root for him even though there are some things he does that make you question why you are rooting for him. Supporting Characters Jonathan Banks as Mike is given a larger role this season and he is fantastic in the role, it is really cool to see the genesis of some of his relationships with characters that will take place on Breaking Bad. His story takes over the majority of the first half of the season and it is great seeing Banks being given a bit more time to shine this season. Rhea Seehorn is Kim Wexler and her character goes through quite a bit this seaosn, she like Odenkirk has real shades of grey to her character but you can tell she is more law abiding then he is. Their chemistry together is fantastic and you are really rooting for them to succeed as lawyers and as a couple. Patrick Fabian as Howard & Michael Mckean as Chuck are real highlights of the show they are great antagonists on the show, they made me dislike them so much that I really wanted to see McGill beat them. But they also have depth to them and you see they have issues themselves that makes them human and even feel a bit sorry for them especially Chuck at times which is handled very well. A character that has been present but not hand much to do is Michael Mando as Nacho but this changes a bit this season, he is given more to do and it is interesting to see how he fits in the gang war between the drug lords who I won't reveal who they are in case you don't know. Story As mentioned it feels like the first half of the season really focuses on Mike and the gang warfare element whereas the 2nd half focused more on Jimmy and his issues. I enjoyed both thoroughly but feel like they maybe could have been condensed to make it more compelling as there is a few parts of the plot I felt was less compelling to watch. Also it takes like the first two episodes for anything to happen in the gang plot but if you have seen Breaking Bad you know more then the characters which makes it a bit of a frustrating watch and you just wish it could move a little bit quicker. The end of the season is really handled well though and it really gets you interested in the next season and what is to come. Script The script is great on this show, the humour is reall well done and seeing McGill charm his way out of lots of potentially dangerous situations is very gratifing to watch. Also the drama is really well handled, the courtroom scenes in particular bring real emotion out of the characters that feels very real and personal. Style This Season the show focuses on the courtroom aspect of the show and I Love it, I am a sucker for great courtroom scenes and episodes of shows as it is fascinating watching it develop with our characters and trying to work out what will happen next. However, my complaint with the show since I started watching it is the pacing, the tension and aggressive pacing of Breaking Bad is not to be seen here and that is fine as this is a different show but there are times when it really does drag and I feel like maybe it could have done with being 8 episodes instead of 10. Overall Overall this is another great season of the show, you can really see the evolution of Jimmy McGill's character and this is a great watch of a show that really focuses on interesting characters.", "reviewTitle": "A Great Third Season that Focuses On Interesting Characters", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-26", "titleId": "/title/tt3032476/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "snowfre", "userId": "/user/ur94859844/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.43649790959495943, "id": "/title/tt3032476/userreviews/rw5011790", "interestingVotes": {"down": 1, "up": 5}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Let's face it, when I heard that a prequel spin-off on the greatest show ever, \"Breaking Bad\" was in the making, I had my fears.

It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.\n\nFor those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.\n\nWatching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.\n\nI rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't \"bond\" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.\n\nWatch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are \"walking\" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of \"shell shock,\" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nFor original WW1 footage, watch \"They Shall Never Grow Old,\" an exceptional documentary.", "reviewTitle": "Review from a combat veteran.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-13", "titleId": "/title/tt8579674/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "tgrafflin", "userId": "/user/ur20889743/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7311476467025488, "id": "/title/tt8579674/userreviews/rw5384922", "interestingVotes": {"down": 207, "up": 658}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I sat in a packed yet silent theater this morning and watched, what I believe to be, the next Academy Award winner for the Best Picture.

The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.\n\nThe use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I feel Mr. Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.\n\nThere was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film. The dialogue was great and certainly was a key component of making the single shot method work here. There is no pointless exposition in the movie.\n\nThis isn't a piece to glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all the while showing their vulnerabilities and fear that any normal person would feel in that type of situation. There are no gratuitous bits in the film to exemplify heroism, just a simple story that allows the characters to shine and define bravery on their own terms.\n\nFrom the acting, to the score, to the cinematography, editing and overall direction of the film Mr. Mendes absolutely knocked it out of the park. This isn't just one of the best war movies of all time, I believe it's truly one of the best pieces of film to ever grace the big screen. 1917 will leave you breathless and for many like myself, in tears when the journey comes to and end.\n\nBravo!!", "reviewTitle": "One of the greatest war movies of all time", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-28", "titleId": "/title/tt8579674/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "aarongnr", "userId": "/user/ur69858713/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5620151173708076, "id": "/title/tt8579674/userreviews/rw5412781", "interestingVotes": {"down": 196, "up": 301}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "It still wasn't fully satisfying for me.\n\nObviously the story is pretty much one line: deliver this message.

Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.\n\nFilmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.\n\nRoger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.\n\n1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade.

I was really into the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. I was engaged and thinking about how I was going to tell my sons that if they get a chance to go watch it in the theater. The cinematography and music were gripping. Then..... as the 2 main characters (solider A and soldier B) get through the initial German traps, and enter into an open field with a cow, a barn, and a pale of fresh milk, the movie goes down hill fast. I was literally laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot and situations. A & B, whose duty it is to transport a message to (2) battalions, warning the battalions are falling into a German trap. Soldier A, has an older brother who is possibly going to be slaughtered in the trap. With the cow and milk pale in the background, A & B find themselves helping a German airplane pilot out of his burning plane after witnessing an aerial dog fight. This is right after they go through hundreds of yards of seeing their dead countrymen. This is also after they almost get blown up (should have been into 1000 pieces) from booty traps (goonies reference). They help the German guy? Help him? Well, the German guy proceeds to knife Soldier A and kill him. That sequence made me almost leave the theater. I should have because the remaining parts of the movie just got worse. Soldier B still had a message to deliver. B proceeded to get picked up by a convoy of English Soldiers in trucks, who showed up a split second after the cow, milk, plane sequence. As if the trucks showing up was not ridiculous enough, the truck B was in got stuck in the mud moments later. B then convinces 15 or so other soldiers to help him push it out of the mud. Well, they miraculously do this, only to find that they can drive another few hundred yards. Our message delivering solider B leaves them and then now has to make it past the storm trooper German snipers. I call them storm troopers, because just like storm troopers, they are unable to hit their target. On one of the first sniper situations, the sniper gets hit by a bullet, so B thinks. However, when B goes to check to see if he shot the sniper, he opens the door full swing with his entire body facing the wounded sniper. B then takes a bullet? Or something happens where he gets knocked back down a small flight of stairs. After he wakes, he evades some more storm troopers, then kicks open a small horizontal door to find a woman and a baby, along with a beautiful fire. Thankfully B had fresh milk. B then leaves as it is getting close to morning. He evades a couple storm troopers only to find a younger storm trooper that he tries to shush. B actually puts his finger up to the storm trooper to shush him? Huh? Was this part of Jedi training? When that doesn't work he chokes him instead. Much to B's surprise, the choking worked better than the shushing. Go figure? B then runs and runs evading lots of lots of laser guns. Oops sorry, bullets. Then he jumps into a raging river where he smashes his head. Thankfully he has a hard head. If that is not silly enough, the rivers puts him exactly where he needs to be. Right up to a Battalion sitting in a large circle, listening to a guy singing. UGH, that was so bad. B still needs to get his dry message that was soaked in the river to the commander. He proceeds to evade lots of bombs from enemy fire to do this. But thankfully B makes it. A cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as the commander cannot save this flop. B saves the second wave. B meets A's brother, even though he was in the first wave that was already deployed and supposed to be slaughtered.\n\nI just have to say why? Why do we need to accept these movies and call them Oscar winners? Yes, the cinematography should get an award possibly. Maybe the score.

The scenes of the trenches, dead horses, bomb craters etc really put you in the scenes, and I was blown away by the film from a visual point of view.

(I'm about to reveal spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen it). So we all know that it's true that German forces retreated from trenches at times. As the distance between allied and opposing forces was as matter of yards in many cases, the fact they had abandoned their line would have been obvious over a relatively short period of time to the allies, because of air and recon intelligence. When the rat triggered the trip wire, both men were literally on top of the trap. It was a big enough explosion to collapse the entire tunnel, but they both survived without a scratch. After the pilot killed Blake, almost straight away, Schofield was suddenly joined by a huge troop of British Allies. Where did they come from? Why didn't they just take the message? When they drop Schofield off, he immediately starts getting sniped, while the troops are presumably right next to him. Why didn't they shoot back to help? Where did they disappear to? When Schofield is being chased, he kicks a door through in clear view of his pursuer, and the pursuer just runs on. Leaving Schofield to spend a random night with a woman and baby who happened to be surviving on their own with no food and water, hidden in the same ruins as German troops. There are more.

For example, Stephen Knight's Locke is one man, in a car, by himself - and it's riveting. Die Hard takes place (mostly) in a single blinding. 1917 sets a limitation for itself by presenting the movie as a single continuous shot. (It's really at least three, but that's beside the point.)\n\nThe rationale is that this would immerse the viewer in the experience of the war. And despite Deakins skill in pulling off the achievement, I think it does the opposite. It's awkward at times, distracting, and gives up the foundational language of film: the power of editing. Some thoughts:\n\n\n* Cutting focuses our attention, shifts our point of view, can put us both inside and outside the experience of the characters.\n\n\n\n* The long shots of the characters walking toward the camera in the trenches are off putting. They are completely unlike the way we experience reality - how often do we hold a steady gaze on a single point while walking in real life? It's meant to be subjective and immersive, but it's the opposite.\n\n\n\n* Things get better outside of the trench when the camera has more movement, but get worse in the ruined village, a sequence that looks more like a video game with new pursuers appearing in the channel behind him.\n\n\n\n* The monotony of the single tales had me looking around the frame for the bodies in the mud, pressed in the trench walls, etc. - impressive art direction, but distracting, pulling me out of the story.\n\n\nThe bodies sticking out of the mud were supposed to be horrifying, but they struck me as antiseptic. And one reminded me of Davy Jones ship in the second Pirates movie, which made me laugh inappropriately.\n\nThe real problem is that we have scene this movie before. The plot is the same as Saving Private Ryan, or even Thin Red Line or the Naked and the Dead, which were also built around a single mission. I think Mendes tried to overcome a familiar story with the single take idea. I also think that he can't resist sentimentalizing the story and reaching for unearned emotion.\n\nThe flaws of the movie are seen in the far to brief appearance of Mark Strong, who is strong, grounded, real, everything the rest of the movie is not. A more cinematic approach, and a story more grounded in human experience, and built out of characterizations like Strong's, would have been much more interesting.\n\nAs it is, 1917 is a mildly interesting experiment with a conventional story at its center.", "reviewTitle": "Dissenting view: technical achievement, mediocre movie", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-03", "titleId": "/title/tt8579674/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "tomholland2016", "userId": "/user/ur58447224/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4895458890236518, "id": "/title/tt8579674/userreviews/rw5393345", "interestingVotes": {"down": 115, "up": 141}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "It features a realistic portrayal of a true remarkable story following the appalling journey of two soldiers having to call off the attack against Germany.\n\n1917 is a massive technical achievement done right. The camera tracks this pair of individuals with a smooth good-looking one continuous shot for 110 mins! Despite it's not exactly one shot, the slick technique where it manages to trick the audience's eyes when a one shot jumps from the other is brilliant.\n\nCinematography is riveting to the eyes. There are so many important close-ups that picture a thousand words of these two soldiers about their past and their emotional trauma of the World War 1 effect. The better thing is it knows when to pull back from those close-ups to reveal the true scale of the horrendous and the shock of the battlefield.\n\nImmersively done, 1917 sucks you into the sheer horror of experiencing the daunting moments of World War 1. You will feel as if you are walking with these men.\n\n1917 is a highly suspenseful film from the front 'till the end of the line. I can assure you, the intensity is greater than 90% horror movies in the last decade. Sam Mendes escalates the tense atmosphere little by little before he uncovers everything in the final 20 minutes.\n\nThe set feels very much like a breath of air back in the early 1900s. It is unrelenting seeing objects, locations and soldiers are bombed into pieces, excellently enhanced by how specific the layouts are to justify the maddening era of bloodbath.\n\nThough feels gimmicky, the music projects a powerful influence in increasing the gritty war moments and giving the sense that every scene should be appreciated as much as possible.\n\nGeorge Mackay & Dean Chapman's performances are great however, I wish they could give more. The former expresses his raw emotions clearly but sometimes, he falls flat and the latter's way of characters feels quite unbelievable due to Chapman's failure to construct expressions that is substantially connected to the impacts of war. For mega-awards like Golden Globe & Oscar, the lack of creativity to create nuances details on their face, resulted in them not nominated for Best Actor/Supporting Actor.\n\n1917 renders much of a survival movie like Dunkirk rather than non-stopping war shootings genre. The plot is where the downside comes. Mind that it is great and propulsively executed but the emptiness of the sub-stories is what 1917 suffers.\n\n1917 also hurts by putting in dialogues that does not drive the story further, but only to give a sense of what personality the characters embody.\n\nVerdict: 1917 is a warfare that feels immersive and nerve-wracking with its glorious cinematography and visual designs however, it occasionally steps into the landmines which is forgivable as the whole movie transmits an experience that is substantially novelty and worth living for.", "reviewTitle": "A century and three years old, 1917 relives the terrifying but excellent journey of two unsung heroes.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-09", "titleId": "/title/tt8579674/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "rossmcdee1", "userId": "/user/ur20217147/"}, "authorRating": 2, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4734370478884683, "id": "/title/tt8579674/userreviews/rw5427763", "interestingVotes": {"down": 148, "up": 166}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Superb film making craftsmanship (& mostly excellent acting) wasted on a stupidly realised story.

If the movie is really bad I tend to write the review straight away so I can get it out of my mind and never have to think about it again. When a film is good, as I find most are, then I tend to wait two to three days to collect my thoughts, do some background research and write it with a clear mind. But occasionally I see a film which absolutely blows me away. These types of films come around rarely but when they do I have to really sit back, take a deep breath and comprehend just how I'm going to convey how good it is in words. 1917 is that type of film - a movie that displays technical wizardry behind the camera and amazing work in front of it. It's been six days since I've watched 1917 and I'm still in absolute awe of what I witnessed!\n\nThe year is of course 1917. Deep in the heart of France British soldiers battle the Germans in what appears to be insurmountable odds. It's on the battlefield that we meet two young soldiers, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George Mackay). They've just been assigned an impossible mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth): travel by foot behind enemy lines, avoiding German snipers and artillery, to find a British battalion that is about to walk into a trap set up by the Germans. It's a task so dangerous it will probably cost both men their lives, but if they fail it will lead to the massacre of 1,600 British soldiers. Adding to the urgency of the assignment, Blake's older brother is one of the 1,600 soldiers about to walk into the ambush!\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nAfter reading the above description you're probably wondering what makes this film so spellbinding. Well it's the way that it has been filmed that really puts it above other war films. Director Sam Mendes (Skyfall, American Beauty) and cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, Blade Runner 2049) have collaborated to come up with a style of filming that makes it look like one long tracking shot that never takes a break or cuts away. We follow soldiers Blake and Schofield all the way through their mission in real time: walking though crowded bunkers, dodging snipers and crawling through mud as if we are there with them. As an audience member it's disorienting, confronting and an absolute cinematic masterpiece like I've never witnessed before. This is a film that just HAS TO be seen in the cinema to get the full experience. It's a movie that really shows the horrors of war with scenes that will shock you and sounds that will scare you. A lot of people may compare it to Saving Private Ryan but I think it may even be better than that!\n\nTHE BAD\n\nApart from a couple of nit-picky things there is nothing bad about this movie. There are cameos galore where the famous actor always has his back toward the camera and then dramatically turns around as if to say 'look it's me!', and a lot of the story does fall into place rather too nicely, but nothing took away from my enjoyment or made me feel as I was watching 'just another movie'. Throughout this film's two hour running time I felt as if I was on this mission with these two soldiers and absolutely nothing took me out of it until the very end credits.\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nMendes has managed to capture the horrors of war in full, gory detail. From dirty, rat infested bunkers to brutal deaths and amputations, nothing is off limits as 1917 definitely doesn't glamorise what these brave men in the British armed forces had to go through. It may not be easy to watch for those of you with a weak stomach but it is probably a very accurate portrayal of what really happened in World War One.\n\nThe saying 'you have to see it to believe it' is an accurate statement when talking about 1917. Nothing I write will do justice to the film which definitely requires a second viewing to fully take it in. It's war and it's ugly but the way it has been told is just as engrossing as what is being told. A must see at the cinema!\n\nFIVE MILITARY MEDALS OUT OF FIVE", "reviewTitle": "War is hell, this film is NOT!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-18", "titleId": "/title/tt8579674/"}], "totalReviews": 2226}, "tt8806524": {"@type": "imdb.api.userreviews.userreviewsfortitle", "base": {"id": "/title/tt8806524/", "image": {"height": 3168, "id": "/title/tt8806524/images/rm493657089", "url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzYmQ4NTUtMGVjOS00OWRhLTlmYjktZDlkZTk2OGQ2YjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODkzNTgxMDg@._V1_.jpg", "width": 2232}, "title": "Star Trek: Picard", "titleType": "tvSeries", "year": 2020}, "paginationKey": "g4wp7cjeqi2t43yc7ctxxojwqprmuazhzfmxvlnomwklyczuf43o6ss6oq4ftnbpdb4k4nzgfdails43hrlmpkxmq3rg4ny", "reviews": [{"author": {"displayName": "wilson-michael24", "userId": "/user/ur35422098/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7218510115326174, "id": "/title/tt8806524/userreviews/rw5567548", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 20}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "To be fair, they did warn us that this show wasn't going to be anything like ST: TNG and they were right.\n\nThe problem is they're using a ST icon (Jean-Luc Picard) in order to lure people into watching it and as bad as the show is I'm a huge fan of ST: TNG and Capt.

Perhaps this is one reason why watching old episodes of Star Trek: The Next a Generation still brings so much joy and hope to people? A positive, realistic and intricately-created future world that actually we'd all like to live in and humanity could aspire to.\n\nSo, after scrapping years of terrible 'style-over-substance' reboots and non-intelligent efforts which use the franchise in name only, we now receive Star Trek: Picard.

It's totally unrealistic, straying away from its exploration and evolutionary values of humanity. The musical soundtrack is so over the top and constant, that it makes 80s action film scores seem underplayed.\n\nBut most of all, where has the intelligence gone from this world? Why has technology gone backwards? Why has the Federation, that spawned so many good people built on solid moral principles, regressed to a selfishly immoral antagonist? Why do all the alien races now look the same? Why would a universe ban \"synthetic life\" after a disaster and not work together to find out what went wrong and learn from it?

That's a bad name for this series because there is little to nothing of either in the show.

This is some dystopian version of both.

I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.\n\nSome complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".\n\nIt's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.\n\nIt would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.\n\nInstead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.\n\nAt first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.\n\nKi-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.\n\nThat moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.\n\nAnd he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.\n\nHowever easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.\n\nWith such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.\n\nThe tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.\n\nOf course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.\n\nBut without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.", "reviewTitle": "For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-10-18", "titleId": "/title/tt6751668/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Jeremy_Urquhart", "userId": "/user/ur26226712/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7683584347434272, "id": "/title/tt6751668/userreviews/rw4978432", "interestingVotes": {"down": 373, "up": 1387}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings.

Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).\n\nAnd it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast.

You come to care for just about all of them.\n\nI'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect.

You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. \"It's easy to be nice when you're rich,\" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.\n\nBut it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.\n\nBut in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.\n\nKim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to \"metaphors,\" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.\n\nI want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.\n\nSouth Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.\n\nThe themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the \"Indians\") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.", "reviewTitle": "Meritocracy: it's metaphorical", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-08-25", "titleId": "/title/tt6751668/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "sandeepventrapragada98", "userId": "/user/ur81706971/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6049610333639832, "id": "/title/tt6751668/userreviews/rw5069158", "interestingVotes": {"down": 169, "up": 312}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited.

The film is a reflection upon poverty and wealth, an issue that is visible and salient in South Korea where the film is set. It uses humour, likeable characters, and a mischievous pace to draw in the viewer. Like a frog in the proverbial slowly-heating pot, we unwittingly come to consider what it means to be poor, what it means to be rich, and the volatile interface between the two.\n\nI began watching the film barracking for the various characters of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they weave themselves into the life of the wealthy Park family. The Kim family son, Ki-woo, pretends to be an English tutor to the Park family's daughter. In turn, Ki-woo draws in his sister, Ki-jung, who pretends to be an art therapist, to work with the traumatised Park family son. The mischief expands like a spider web, as the Kim family father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, take further positions within the Park family as their driver and housekeeper. It's a simple premise taken to a ludicrous extreme, making the film both real and not-real.\n\nBeneath the light-hearted tone in which the 'parasitic' enmeshment is established, a dark underbelly of resentment reveals itself as the poorer Kim family inhabits the life of the wealthy Park family. As their unlikely success grows, the Kim family shift from a mindset of sporadic life resignations towards the dangerous realm of possibility. The Kim family may actually find a way out of poverty by inhabiting of the Park family house. The second half of the film shifts gear to explore the violence and ruthless deception that is spawned within this up-close-and-personal straddling of absurd extremes of inequality.\n\nParasite calls on its viewers to understand the dynamics of inequality through this fable-istic account of two families, both having their own type of parasitic relation to each other. The Kim family is parasitic on the money of the Park family; the Park family, in turn, is parasitic on the Kim family to do life's chores. With great agility, the film sidesteps the temptation to valorise the poor or demonise the rich. We like all the characters, but there are no heroes. Instead, Parasite invites us to reflect upon inequality in its inglorious everyday forms. The Park family father doesn't like the smell of the Kim family father, while the Park family son inadvertently almost reveals the Kim family ruse by innocently noting that 'they all smell the same.' Poverty and wealth are not abstract categories; they are smells, experienced differently by rich and poor.\n\nIn this down-to-earth-ness, the filmmaker, Bong Joon-ho, explicitly calls on viewers to interpret the movie on different levels. From the opening scenes, the Kim family son, Ki-woon, repeats the word 'metaphorical.' He is ostensibly talking about a rock that is supposed to bring wealth, but we viewers are left to open up wider horizons of meanings, such as: societies of great inequality must inevitably devolve into transactional-parasitic relations; wealthy families in the midst of poverty must inevitably defend against the social incursions of poorer people doing what they can to survive, as well as defending against the psychological incursions of bad conscience. In every rich household there is something hidden in the basement, as least psychologically.\n\nThis film holds its line against the temptation to explicitly condemn the evils of inequality. Instead it relentlessly represents the dynamics of inequality, drawing away from the judgement of individual characters, leaving it to viewers to make sense of it. Being vague enough to not spoil the ending, the film's climax portrays violence bubbling up as an expression of long-suppressed resentment. It does so in light of a jarring juxtaposition between the despairing circumstances of the poorer family hitting rock bottom, and the oblivious self-centredness of the rich family who are circumstantially geared by the everyday realities of inequality to not want to know about anything outside their bubble.\n\nIf the film has a political point, it shifts the debate about inequality. Instead of talking about the 'deserving poor' or the 'greedy rich', the film describes the impoverished social ecosystem of unequal societies, and the social roles and habits these societies require of their people. Violence in the face of absurd levels of inequality does not come from character flaws. But, rather, it emerges as the breaking point of the logics and habits of inequality taken to their logical extreme.\n\nAn untended pot of boiling water creates scalding steam, and eventually bubbles over.", "reviewTitle": "Parasite: a poignant reflection upon inequality - and funny", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-01", "titleId": "/title/tt6751668/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Fella_shibby", "userId": "/user/ur18970655/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5706065280530797, "id": "/title/tt6751668/userreviews/rw5459301", "interestingVotes": {"down": 34, "up": 68}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Finally saw this much talked about film.

Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.\n\nKim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.", "reviewTitle": "It's so metaphorical", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-01-30", "titleId": "/title/tt6751668/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "impeyrules-54634", "userId": "/user/ur112067187/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5564143270602461, "id": "/title/tt6751668/userreviews/rw5400852", "interestingVotes": {"down": 26, "up": 52}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This is a well written and well perfomed original film.

With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.\n\nIf you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.\n\nThe film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.\n\nThere is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.\n\nFor many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness.

The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time.

However things don't go as planned and his friends have to jump back into the game to rescue him. This time the game also sucks in Spencer's grandfather, played by Danny DeVito and his old business partner Danny Glover (in the best role he's had in well over a decade).\n\nThis time however, the players don't get to choose thier characters and this creates an interesting fish-out-of-water situation that the film employs to it's absolute best use. Moreover, the dual roles pull some surprisingly good impressions from our main video game cast and showcases a range you might not expect from stars like Dwayne Johnson or Terry Crews.\n\nJumanji has a tricky line to walk. Adventure/Comedy is a tough sell, yet Jumanji manages to craft a rollicking good adventure with action and peril, while never completely abandoning the humor. There are of course a fair amount of cheap shots and pratfalls, the movie does feature Jack Black after all. However there's a lot of smart jokes, and humor that doesn't rely on the lowest common denominator. It's exactly the kind of comedy that I love and it never lets up.\n\nThroughout the film, there's a lot of heart, exploring interpersonal relationships against the backdrop of the adventure and ends with a genuine punch the air moment.

From classic comedies like Happy Gilmore to great dramatic performances like Reign Over Me, he has proven time and time again that he is a very talented guy. The problem is that he has let himself fall out of the spotlight over the last ten years, simply due to the fact that he has been choosing some of the worst films of each year, on multiple occasions. In what might be the greatest performance he has ever given, Uncut Gems is his latest role that will be released this fall. After viewing this at the Toronto International Film Festival and giving it a little time to sink in, I can confidently say that this will end up being one of my favourite films of 2019 by year's end.\n\nFollowing a jewelry store owner in Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) as he gets his hands on a precious gemstone from Ethiopia, he decides to lend it to an NBA star in good faith. What sadly becomes apparent is the fact that he has many issues under the surface. Being a really shady figure and having a serious gambling addiction ends up giving this movie an insane amount of tension. This is a roller coaster ride of claustrophobia and I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nDirectors Benny and Josh Safdie have been quietly building a solid little career for themselves. Having worked on very small indie projects like Heaven Knows What and then one of 2017s very best movies in Good Time, they're truly a duo that this industry needs. Their creativity always leaps off the screen in a way that feels very different from other filmmakers working today. This is a movie that heavily relies on pacing, editing, and performances. With a screenplay that requires nearly every performer to constantly be in motion or talking over one another, this movie barely gives you a second to catch a breath.\n\nBy the time the third act begins, you'll probably wonder why you have been so invested in Sandler's portrayal of Howard because he's really not the best person. With that said, it's the fact that he is a terrible person deep down and is so greedy that is what made it so engaging and unnerving at times. With the use of periodic psychedelic imagery, a pulse-poundingly superb score, and a slew of uberly talented performers, Uncut Gems is a movie that states from the very beginning that it's a contender for the upcoming awards season.\n\nOverall, some viewers will absolutely wonder what the point of the movie was, due to the nature of how the final few minutes play out, but it was precisely these final moments that took me off guard and had me loving it even more. Personally, I feel that audiences have become impatient with films these days and anything over an hour and a half may seem like a chore to them if they're not completely on board, so that's why I would recommend this movie. It's not short, but the way this movie is put together makes it fly by. I believe this movie can be appreciated by many viewers. Uncut Gems is easily one of the years best films.", "reviewTitle": "An Intense Roller-Coaster", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-09-15", "titleId": "/title/tt5727208/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "stefanruby", "userId": "/user/ur107779798/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.631297813583987, "id": "/title/tt5727208/userreviews/rw5124342", "interestingVotes": {"down": 218, "up": 439}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Saw this at TIFF.

First things first. This is not an \"Adam Sandler movie\". Yes, he is the star and the focus of the advertising, but, this is very much a \"Safdie Brothers film\". Emphasis on \"film\". Benny and Josh Safdie are very much in love with the look and feel of the films of the 70s and 80s, in particular. But, as with GOOD TIME, they are not interested in doing a cutesy wink-wink homage. It's in their bones. Sandler plays Howard, New York city jeweler who's also a full-time hustler. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) is falling apart, his gambling debts are piling up and he is facing health issues. He banks his future on an Ethiopian rock which houses the title valuables. Also involved are a two-bit floozy he's carrying on with (Julia Fox) and Boston Celtics legend Kevin Garnett - playing himself. From the get-go, the Safdie Brothers (who also co-wrote with Ronald Bonstein) bring enormous energy and drive to the proceedings. Sandler starts at 11 and goes from there. Similarly, Daniel Lopatin's score is often mixed so high it becomes intrusive at times (the synth music itself isn't bad, sort of a retro blend of Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre). Darius Khondij's 35mm photography is both slick and gritty. Director Yorgos Lanthimos (THE FAVOURITE) has remarked that UNCUT GEMS is like \"a Robert Altman film that was dipped in acid.\" Altman's 1974 CALIFORNIA SPLIT certainly fits the time period and some of the themes. Of course, Altman was an original and as many of his admirers have found out over the years, overlapping dialogue and naturalistic atmosphere do not alone make an \"Altman film\" (Altman himself often enough failed to create the unique mood). UNCUT GEMS works because of the filmmaking brio and Sandler's driven performance. Still, at times, it seems to be trying too hard. It works best in the last act when the Safdies let the drama play out more. It's a good film, even if not quite up to GOOD TIME.

While Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett and many others here are natural solid, it's Sandler's show, and it's soulful and tense and harrowing and ultimately (as terrible as Howard can be) tragic. The filmmakers's greatest achievement from the looks of this and Good Time is finding star-actors who aren't known for their wide range and getting career-triumph work from them.

Good Time showed that they are masters of tension and momentum, with their impressive culmination of unique characters, editing, dialogue and of course musical scores, and Uncut Gems further cements that they are not only masters of tension, but they are truly two of the most exciting rising filmmakers right now.\n\nI usually know how to structure a review, but Uncut Gems is so unconventional in nearly every regard, and frankly I'm not quite sure where to start. It doesn't let up, ever. Pretty much from the first minute to the end you are shot into a relentless world of chaos among various reoccurring characters, all gravitating around Adam Sandler's \"Howie\". That leads me to Adam Sandler's performance and character. I LOVED it. Oh boy, is he good. He's not only fantastic at delivering dialogue for extremely long and exhausting takes, but just seeing his characters psyche continuously digging himself deeper is electric.\n\nI'll leave off with saying Uncut Gems is one of the most exhilarating and unique films that I've seen this year. Adam Sandler (and the entire cast) kill it, the musical score is loud and exciting, it looks beautiful, and it has an energy that I haven't seen in any other film this year.\n\nI really can't wait to see what the Safdie's come up with next.", "reviewTitle": "Seen at TIFF 2019", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-09-10", "titleId": "/title/tt5727208/"}], "totalReviews": 1600}, "tt6611916": {"@type": "imdb.api.userreviews.userreviewsfortitle", "base": {"id": "/title/tt6611916/", "image": {"height": 1080, "id": "/title/tt6611916/images/rm3318201857", "url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyMjMzZWYtYTMyMC00NTQ3LTg5NjAtYzhmNjM1MGE5ZTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI2MzI4NTU@._V1_.jpg", "width": 720}, "title": "Kingdom", "titleType": "tvSeries", "year": 2019}, "paginationKey": "g4wp7cjnry3d6zac62xhvmjsrpq4qbjhzfmxvlnomwklyczuf43o6ss7oyyf7mjodn4k5pd6u3ujbkd6r7dftyu6mznqiya", "reviews": [{"author": {"displayName": "Rastifan", "userId": "/user/ur27953094/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.8799310929627052, "id": "/title/tt6611916/userreviews/rw4607454", "interestingVotes": {"down": 33, "up": 345}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "It's hardly a secret that the zombie genre is a dried out well proven by western releases fighting to be the most boring and generic junk out there.

It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.\n\nMoreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the \"subtle\" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.\n\nBtw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!\n\nIn terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning!

The money they invested into this show definitely shows with each episode costing a tad more than 1.78 million dollars. The cinematography is to die for literally lol. The shots in both the action scenes and dramatic yet everyday scenes that were filmed are superb. The tension of the shots is evident at every angle. If you never liked reading subtitles prior you need to fix that crap immediately because this show is so worth it. I hope and pray that they make a season two because as it stands this is my favorite show of 2019 and it's only January and this will undoubtedly remain my new favorite show.

Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.\n\nSeason 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.\n\nSeason 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.\n\nThe biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.\n\nSo can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not.

The Night Kings death was underwhelming. Infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. No Sansa and Cersei confrontation of any sort which I would have liked to have seen. Unbelievable unrealistic plot armour. Rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet Drogon dodges an Iron fleets worth of Scorpions at Kings Landing, which weren't even shooting, just to serve the plot. I guess Euron forgot about Dany's dragon and her forces. Jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected? ) I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocents. It was actually laughable . After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over it. Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen. Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. There are some good moments but very few and far between. Have to appreciate effort by cast, directing and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole.

Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.\n\nSeason 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.\n\nThis brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.\n\nEpisode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.\n\nThe writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'.

It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value.

He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.\n\nAfter watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison.

I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.\n\nWhile certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.\n\nSpecial effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.\n\nAll and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.\n\nUPDATE\n\nAfter watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.\n\nIn addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).\n\nTop form, HBO.

I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. \n\nSo when I saw the preview for \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. \n\nI was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. \n\nThe acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. \n\nIf you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. \n\nIf you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. \n\nEach episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. \n\nA special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. \n\nEven after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.", "reviewTitle": "Finally, a Show that stays true to it's written roots", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2011-04-18", "titleId": "/title/tt0944947/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "adamheritage-15333", "userId": "/user/ur63492059/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6982971155955852, "id": "/title/tt0944947/userreviews/rw4831647", "interestingVotes": {"down": 115, "up": 329}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "First off, I used to have a 10/10 for the show but after watching season 8 ep 3, I can no longer consider it a masterpiece.

However I'm still giving GOT as a whole 8/10 because of what the show once was, but season 8 has ruined it. Their best hope now is to hire some new writers and redo season eight with 10 episodes, so key moments are spaced out and not feel all jumbled together like they do currently, and give more justice to the night king so that GOT can go out with a bang and be remembered as the greatest show that ever was, like it was supposed to.", "reviewTitle": "Can we please just restart season 8, perhaps 7 as well, but mainly 8", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-05-06", "titleId": "/title/tt0944947/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "akhil-marsonya27", "userId": "/user/ur48950486/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6903372729759092, "id": "/title/tt0944947/userreviews/rw4876207", "interestingVotes": {"down": 96, "up": 270}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Dear Dan and Dave,\n\nI have long been a huge fan and an avid supporter of Game of Thrones all the way since Season 1, granted I regretfully have not had the joys of reading any of the wonderful George RR Martins books. I have, however spent hundreds of hours exploring the Game of Thrones lore, history of Westeros, fan theories, detailed interviews and everything in-between - It's fair to say I'm a more passion fan than most.\n\nI am no Hollywood writer - or in fact any writer for that matter - but I believe I share the opinion of so many GoT fans. I want to start off by saying thank you. Thank you to the visual effects crew, stunt co-ordinators, body doubles, extras, set designers, costume designers, camera men, George RR Martin, directors, the brilliant actors and so many other people behind the scenes of this once all-time great show - Not only have we the fans been incredibly let down, but the people who have put their physical blood, sweat and tears into the show have also had their beautiful hard work defiled.\n\nI could go into incredible detail about all the things wrong with this season, some notable events: Jon being exiled for killing Danny who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people, Jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of Danny going mad, Bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, Drogon flying off into the 'sunset', Rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of Sansa and Arya's when Jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for Jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... He literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.\n\nWith the holes in the show - and there as so many - I think it's a pathetic excuse of an ending. HBO wanted 10 seasons, but foolishly Dan Weiss and David Benioff decided they had enough, they wanted to wrap the show up so they could make mountains of money butchering yet another beloved franchise (Star Wars). I understand that not everything deserves a happy and perfect ending, nor can you please everyone. However, we spent nearly a decade following these wonderful characters, watching them develop and intelligently interact with each other since season 1. The ending to this show will never be forgotten, for the wrong reasons unfortunately. I hope Dan and David come out and apologise to the fans, we are the people that kept the show running, without the fans support there would have been no Game of Thrones on TV at all.\n\nThe characters deserved better. The whole crew deserved better. The fans deserved better.

The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?\n\nTHIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens.\n\nWhat to expect? Plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode.

The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.\n\n'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every \"country\", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books \u2013 but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.\n\nYet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the \u2013 many \u2013 others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).\n\nThere have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is \u2013 at the moment \u2013 in a league of its own.

They got \"Jake in Progress,\" \"Eyes\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" - but \"Grey's Anatomy\" is definitely considered the best out of those three.\n\nGrey's Anatomy stars Ellen Pompeo (who has starred in a few movies but was never really noticeable) as the narrator - Meredith Grey. Her mother is the famous surgeon and she is trying to follow in her mother's footsteps. The story revolves around her time as an intern and the people she meets and sort of is portrayed as \"survival camp for medical students.\" The minute she arrives at work, she meets Christina Yang (Sandra Oh - flawless in her bitchy supporting role), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight - one word: breakthrough performer), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heighl - very, very believable as a model who is more like the girl-next-door), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers - plays sort of a not-so-likable person). Most of all, there is Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey - very attractive), the man that Meredith had a one-night stand with - he just happens to be her boss.\n\nThis is a show that wants to be liked. It just sort of screams in your face \"Love me!\" with all its interesting characters who are very different from each other and a nice plot that you just have to be addicted to. The supporting work is clearly a winner. It has a very lovable supporting cast with T.R. Knight as the sweet and sort of the \"average guy\" as George O'Malley and Katherine Heigl who is very likable in her role - even Sandra Oh is a clear winner on top. And my personal favorite is \"the Nazi\" - Dr. Miranda Bailey who is played by Chandra Wilson. Very, very well done.\n\nThis is sort of a soapy spin on \"Scrubs\" and \"ER\" but with light comedy/romance and serious and intense drama where character build up the plot. Some of the characters may get a bit annoying for your taste (ex. Meredith Grey) but the acting is just superb and you can't help liking it. It has a guilty-pleasure feel to it and you just can't help but stay up late for this show. This show is definitely not about \"medicine\" - when it has to deal with medicine, it has a clear soft side to it. The doctors play heroes (pretty clich\u00e9d, but yeah - this IS a hospital show) and save lives or care or has to live up to certain defeat.

Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that \"Ally\" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like \"Arli$$,\" if not to save it.

Grey's Anatomy hour meant NO TALKING hour!! I was so in love with the series that to this day I watch older seasons on Netflix once or twice a year! Up to the middle of the 9th season that is....\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nWe were all sad when they killed Denny, though he wasn't a main character, he would have made a good one, I think we all loved Izzie and Denny. And we were ABSOLUTELY DEVSTATED when George died! Those were okay though, we could got through those and it was great in between and I didn't care even a little bit when Burke left, I never cared for him.\n\nBUT THEN.... The plane crash!! What an amazing couple of episodes, until you got to the end of them and realized that up to this point they had killed off 40% of the main cast AND your favorites none the less!! Lexi and Mark!! REALLY!! They were just getting ready to get back together! It was simply too much.\n\nKilling off so many main characters didn't do the series any favors, and adding the characters that they did, it RUINED it. Amelia? Ugh she's so annoying, her character has a daddy/big brother complex that she cant seem to get over so she's constantly in a power struggle with men. Its nauseating, I dislike her character very much. Meredith's sister though, I hate her so much I cant even remember her name, she's HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE actress, HORRIBLE, character, HORRIBLE for the show!! Just single handedly dragging the series the bottom. Not to mention killing Jackson & April's baby!! WHAT!! Too much!\n\nSo my personal opinion of this series is, I'm hooked, I have to see it through, but I recommend not watching after midway through the 9th season, its a waste of time and will likely only annoy. I'm giving it a generous 6. Now it used to be a strong 10 and the only reason it still gets a 6 is because of how amazing it USED to be. If I was going by the last 2.5 seasons alone.... I regret to say it would have only a 2.\n\nAfter last nights 4/23/15 episode I am LIVID!! How could Shonda Rhimes make such a big mistake!! I Guarantee this will be the last season because nobody is going to watch it anymore now that she has killed 97% of the original cast/main characters! Not to mention our favorites!! I'm giving up seeing this one through. Last night was the final episode of Grey's Anatomy that I will ever watch, old or new. What an epic failure. My ALL TIME FAVORITE series went from just that to my most hated one. YOU Don't KILL 97% OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS!

At random intervals. So, be warned. And before you shot my opinions down, know that I've watched most of the episodes. Why? Dunno. Nothing better was on TV, I guess.\n\nI honestly don't understand the rave reviews or high ratings. Most of the negative reviews I've read here say that Grey's Anatomy \"used to be good\". No. It never was. The first few seasons were watchable, I'll give you that. Although, could've been just because when I started watching it 10 years ago, I was still a teenager. I never \"loved\" this show. It was just something I started watching just because it was a medical show. Sometimes they'd present an interesting case, and my best friend was watching it so we both kept at it and liked to talk about everyone being idiots.\n\nThe only character I've ever liked on this show was Danny. His death was sad, sure. It led to some \"outrageous\" developments. Only, when you keep watching, you realizing that his death and all the drama surrounding it wasn't anything special. The crazy kept a steady pace, just having a slightly different flavor each week.\n\nThe first time I questioned why I even kept watching such a ridiculous show was when Izzy started seeing \"Danny's Ghost\". I don't remember the season, but I guess it was pretty early on. Oh, don't get me wrong, it was plenty stupid up to that point. Everyone acting like children. Talking like idiots. Talking during surgeries. Characters talking in this annoying pattern of theirs. Situations/patients seamlessly reflecting on other character's personal lives. Oh, right. Danny's Ghost. I mean, my opinion on these idiots wasn't very good, but as someone who's been through med school, or just a regular person with more than two brain cells, shouldn't seeing and speaking and boning your dead lover have sufficed in turning a few red lights on? No? Really? K. Because Izzy, being a character on Grey's, didn't go straight to the obvious - which is brain cancer. Or at least the inhalation of some mind altering substance. Nope. She went with ghost.\n\nAll the other characters were just as annoying. I didn't care about anyone dying or leaving. Or even going lesbian. But never gay. Oh, no sir! We can't have no f*** on Grey's Anatomy! Only lesbians. Which is hilarious to me. Why no gays, Shonda? \n\nThen stuff happened. New interns were introduced. New tensions. It wasn't any worse than it was. It progressively kept getting more ridiculous and melodramatic, but not worse. Why? Because you can't get worse and fall down any lower than bad Grey's Anatomy. It's THAT bad.\n\nThen most of those interns left. And I didn't care LOL. Oh, in the last season (I think), it turns out that Meredith had ANOTHER sister (besides dear, idiot Lexi), this time from her mother! And she was Richard's kid too! Their interaction is silly, but probably the least stupid in the entire show. Because what do you really do in that situations, which on its own, was completely stupid. Oh, and Derek dies. Haha. And of course, Penny, the lamest redhead I've ever seen and the person who was part of Derek's medical team and the one who told Meredith of his death is gonna make a comeback and be a character. \n\nWhich leads us to the current season. The season that used the phrase \"check your white privilege\" seriously. Without flinching. Without laughing. Although Amelia, while nodding in agreement, did look like she was about to burst out laughing. \n\nSo, Maggie, Meredith's sis, is super smart (like all the main characters in that hospital, she's a \"superstar\"), who's responsible for the \"check your white privilege\" sentence, does some pretty dumb things and acts like a child. But less so than the others, I guess. Good for her. She'll probably take over if the actress who portrays Meredith decides to step down. But who cares. She's not any worse.\n\nAnd speaking of Meredith. The actress really does a poor job at being whatever she's supposed to be, according to her own words \"dark and edgy\" and whatever else. She's... just there. Any meat that's ever been on her bones has been eaten away by season after season of overblown melodrama and general crazy.\n\nKali and Arizona don't make it. Even after the musical episode. Oh well. They go on their separate ways eventually, and Kali starts dating none other than Penny, the intern Meredith blames for killing her hubby! As if she bore the sole responsibility, being a mere intern. And plot twist! Miranda (who continues to be useless idiot) hired Penny to work in the hospital! And Meredith's like \"yeah, OK, fine, I'll be the bigger man\". Why? Freaking why? There're plenty of other hospitals where the entire leading flock of the hospital isn't going to hate her and prevent her from advancing. But NOOOO. Let's leave her in! Because drama!\n\nAnd it just goes on and on and on... The cycle of crazy never ends, with the creator having to take it to the next level every damn time, because otherwise, it's not gonna be dramatic enough.\n\nAnd again, as to why I keep watching... It's become my weekly masochistic amusement. The show is so bad it hurts. Mocking those idiots is the only positive I can find in this show.\n\nSeriously though, who in their right mind would want to be operated on by these morons?

Then I'm thinking maybe it's not supposed to be serious, but soon I realize the comedy is so weak and clich\u00e9 I quickly switch shows.

Nobody expects an intern to operate solo. Getting a Chinese interpreter takes 5 minutes. Even a junior med student knows that. Interns and residents are not nearly as dumb as they are portrayed here. The job of the intern is to do scut work. It's really not that hard. You're just a glorified secretary for your superiors. You don't save lives. You don't dole out bad news to family. You don't really even scrub into cases that much. Cut-throat competitiveness is the exception among interns. Camaraderie is the norm. Also, for God's sake nobody touches their mask with bloody gloves. You don't take off your mask in the OR to talk. I could go on and on. It would be nice if Hollywood would hire even a med student as a consultant and pay them a nominal wage to get a little shred of realism.\n\nI might sound overly critical but the lack of insight in Grey's Anatomy is not simply annoying but actually forces you to not take the show seriously. On the other hand ER was the most faithful in this regard and I guess that's expected since it was produced by Michael Creighton. Too bad it was not about surgeons. Even Scrubs is much more accurate and ten times more entertaining. I bought two episodes of Grey's. That's 90 minutes and 4 bucks I'll never get back.

The movie seemed to jump from scene to scene and introduce character after character with no regards to the story. The action looks okay, passable for modern CGI, but it feels so generic and reminds me of movies like Taken 3, etc. Tack on a generic chase scene in Italy, motorcycle and everything. The pacing in this movie is terrible, jumping from Macedonia, to Italy, to another place in Italy, to a lab, back to Italy, etc. It went from talking to action and back and forth with no regards for plot or development. Think of the typical movie, with exposition, rising action, etc., and this movie does none of it. There's a resolution and action scenes. It feels like they cut out important parts just to get to more action. A further embarrassment is the female representation in this movie. I'm not saying this movie had to have any strong female characters or leads, but this one tried and failed. The only reason his wife existed was to get \"killed\" and turn him into a soldier, and later was found alive and to have moved on (also this scene immediately and jarringly cuts to an action scene). The female lead has some boring character development no thanks to Vin Diesel's very emotional acting. She is only really there to be hot, look cool in some scenes and complement Vin Diesel's character. There was surprisingly not a forced romance, though it seemed hinted (There was odd scene near the \"dead wife\" scene where the female lead is swimming in a pool, and they get the typical Hollywood shots of her in her swimsuit. SPOILERS AHEAD The male hacker dude is just there as comedic relief, guards are there just to be stupid cannon fodder. The wife-killers are killed in 5 minutes, and the main baddie is killed in a very generic scene where you think Vin Diesel's going to die, but he pulls out a grenade and kills himself and the main bad guy, but nope, hacker dude resurrects Vin Diesel, making the sacrifice seem meaningless (as if it had any meaning anyway). All humor in this movie just bounces off Vin Diesel. It's like people are making jokes to the audience, not to each other. Hacker dude is the best character in this movie, only because he's a little funny. Overall, I would not go to see this again, I regret seeing it the first time.

I wasn't familiar with the comic book character, but I always get a kick out of Vin Diesel and was ready for a fun popcorn flick. \"Welcome to the circus\" says one of the wounded/enhanced warriors when Ray Garrison joins the super-human squad of medically-enhanced bio soldiers. Cue the popcorn. Most people are calling this a \"one and done\", meaning it's entertaining enough to watch it once but it won't be anything people will want to watch over and over again.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of violence with various weapons, as well as hand-to-hand combat. Some scenes of blood. No surprise considering the title of the film, right? You see a married couple in bed and a side view from the topless wife. Lots of destruction of property. High body count. Some sexual references in conversation. Reference to Trojan Horse strategy that kids may not understand. Disregard for human life. Some profanity.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED: If you're a Vin Diesel fan, you'll enjoy his performance and all the action that usually accompanies the movies he's in. The first time I remember seeing Guy Pearce was in the movie The Count Of Monte Cristo I thought he was excellent in that film and I've enjoyed every performance I've ever seen him in since. I was happy to see him in this too, although much of his talent was wasted. Eiza Gonzalez is tough and sexy. She first caught my attention in Baby Driver. I love that quirky, musically-entertaining action movie. She mostly makes out with Jon Hamm in that movie, but has a lot more to do in this one. Some cool slow-motion Michael Bay action sequences. Some people think that's super cliche but I really liked it. You get to travel to several locations around the world. Socks with sandals. Ha ha The musical sequence with Toby Kebbell's character was pretty entertaining. Act 1 is very serious, but the humor kicks in about halfway through the movie and really changes the tone of the film from a drama to an entertaining superhero flick. I was impressed by Lamorne Morris' British accent. He first came on to my radar as a funnyman American in the popular TV sitcom New Girl: Season 1. Did you know he studied acting on a Chris Farley Memorial Scholarship? That's cool that such a scholarship even exists! The movie is directed by David Wilson. He actually does a pretty good job mixing full-on action with scenes of computer nerds typing furiously.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: There are some serious plot holes in the story. I'm sure things would have made more sense to me if I had read the comic books. A lot of things about Vin Diesel's character are simply not explained, like why does he glow? Did I miss an explanation? The villain played by Toby Kebbell turns into a pansy within minutes of fire power. I think he looks a lot like Enrique Iglesias. What do you think? Other than some twists, there are some predictable tropes. Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel's character) is pretty robotic to begin with, so adding nanotechnology to his blood doesn't really change his personality in an interesting way. We never quite understand what everyone's motivations are. We are never given much backstory on the characters, so they're all fairly one dimensional. Avoid watching the trailer if you can since it reveals much of the story. Conspiracy...blah blah...seen it before...blah blah...

The script itself housed very funny one liners, particularly form Spacey's character. But I was amazed at how fast the film itself moved. In the first, you are following these scientists going to Africa to find a virus outbreak. Next thing you know, you're watching a helicopter go head on with a plane.\n\n First comes the acting. Dustin Hoffman is stupendous as always, Rene Russo plays Robbie with realism, Kevin Spacey makes for a good humor man, Cuba Gooding Jr. pulls off the green man trying to earn respect, and being a bad-ass at the same time. As always, Morgan Freeman is wonderful. Any role I see him in is a role I remember. He's always different, too, neigh does he ever repeat in characterization. Sometimes he's funny, sometimes he's incredibly serious. Last but not least comes Donald Sutherland, one of my favorite actors to date. He can jump into the shoes of any character, including the general trying to protect a secret he knows he shouldn't. One actor whom I particularly enjoyed watching was J.T. Walsh. It's a great shame he died, I liked all his stuff from Breakdown to Pleasantville. He is only in Outbreak for about five minutes, but he has one of my favorite monologues in the history of film. He commands attention as he speaks.\n\n Next comes the story itself. A very to-date story. A one all can relate to because it could very well happen. A virus from Africa makes its way here and begins infecting all, without a cure. I liked that there was a hero aspect in Sam Daniels. he was the tracker, the hunter, the curist. Coupled with the story comes the dialogue. Rich, under-appreciated, funny, and serious all wrapped into one. As I said before, the monologue for Walsh is brilliant. Many lines are etched into my mind, and are often used in conversation. Too bad no one knows what I'm saying.\n\nI'm a bit surprised this film didn't bode too well with audiences. Mayhap they didn't want to see what could happen, who knows? My only complaint is character endings. You insinuate what happens to McClintock and Ford, also Sam and Robbie, but we don't ever see Casey again. I could infer that he dies, but he could very well have survived. I wish there was a way to know.\n\nFinally comes Wolfgang Peterson's remarkable direction. I've been a huge fan of his movies since this movie, including Air Force One, Enemy Mine, not much for Perfect Storm, but his upcoming Ender's Game should be good.\n\n At the end, I felt a certain sense of relief and wonderment. But I have to say the soundtrack is rather exquisite. I have always liked James Newton Howard, and though the cd is short in time, it's a time I cannot forget. Particularly the end theme when it's chopper vs. plane time. What a song, keeps me in suspense every time. I like songs that are taken for film trailers as well. It's still too bad not a lot of people know about this movie.\n\n9 out of 10", "reviewTitle": "Terrific", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2004-04-25", "titleId": "/title/tt0114069/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "FilmFanInTheHouse", "userId": "/user/ur4478810/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.619153321118116, "id": "/title/tt0114069/userreviews/rw1959231", "interestingVotes": {"down": 8, "up": 28}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Outbreak (1995, Dir.

For me, the best parts of the film were where we see how the virus spreads among the unsuspecting - a scratch, a sneeze, or a cough. In the film's most celebrated sequence, a carrier coughs into a packed cinema, and we watch the particles zoom through the air before being inhaled by somebody who should have kept their mouth shut. This method of \"quiet death\" is extremely frightening and believable, and makes you feel like locking your doors and staying inside for the rest of your life.\n\nElsewhere, it's business as usual, with a miscast Dustin Hoffman running around ignoring his superiors and doing his darnedest to try and save lives. The reliable Morgan Freeman appears as Hoffman's long-suffering superior, while Donald Sutherland makes the best of his villainously evil role. In fact, he's so good at it that I'm surprised he hasn't been cast more frequently as the bad guy - but then again his over the top performance in VIRUS may be the reason why. Rene Russo is around to provide a love interest and a woman in peril, and as always I can't stand her performance. A pre-fame Kevin Spacey is good in the small role of a virologist who has a nasty accident in the lab.\n\nThe problem with this film is it's length: at two hours plus, it really drags at some points during the middle of the film. Some of the boring sentimentalising between Hoffman and Russo could easily have been chopped without harming the flow of the film. Thankfully, things regain interest with the action-filled finale, with Hoffman and Cuba Gooding, Jr. getting into a helicopter fight with the evil Sutherland and trying to deliver the vaccine before the town gets nuked. You can guess the ending (this is a Hollywood film, you see) but it's still pretty exciting. Horror fans should come along for the ride to witness a different kind of horror, and there are plenty of diseased bodies laying around to make you feel ill.

For the most part, he and his crew kinda pull it off. The cinematography from Michael Ballhaus, the music by James Newton Howard and the makeup department, led by Ellis Burman Jr were amazing. For the most part, even the acting, was very good, throughout this film. In spite of Kevin Spacey rocking the worst dyed wig, ever. Even the capuchin, Binks was great as the disease carrier, Betsy the monkey. It's just funny, how often, people mistake her for another monkey, Katie. Katie as Marcel is the one that was mock with the fake \"Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan\" poster in the 1990's sitcom 'Friends', not Binks. I don't blame people, for not knowing the different, between the monkeys, after all, the producers didn't. In the end, they all deliver us from Ebola. Without spoiling the movie, too much, there were only a few things that I didn't like, about this film. Most of them, had to do with the inconsistencies on the effects of this disease. Don't get me wrong, I like the way, they describe the virus, as something that will liquefying the internal organs of its victims. However, it's seem to me, that the illness, only turns rapidly and deadly, whenever the film calls for it to act. How on earth can some sick characters only look a bit feverish, pale and dried out, while the other characters has blood streaming from their eyes, nose and mouth, skin destroyed, during the same stage. It's make no sense. Yes, I understand, some bodies might have stronger phagocyte cells than others, but it doesn't explain, how accidentally sticking yourself with a contaminated needle is less severe than breathing in the inflection, due to a small rip in a hazmat suit. According to the head of epidemiology at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health, it's very unrealistic; as there is fewer cases of researcher dying from breathing in an inflection, than those who die, due to direct contact with blood, excretions or saliva. Another thing, I didn't like, about this film is the ability of the scientists in the film, being able to solve most of the illness in a few hours. It seem a bit, impractical. In real-life, vaccine research, often takes months, or even years. Even with that, the only reason, why the scientists work so hard, toward the end, was to save the main character, Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman)'s marital troubles. It's kinda shallow, when you think, deep about it. I really didn't think the movie, needed to add that romantic subplot with Rene Russo's character, Roberta \"Robby\" Keough. It felt, a bit distracting. Another thing, I didn't like is how the film morphs from a medical thriller into another generic government covert military conspiracy action movie. I don't mind, the whole firebomb subplot, but the idea, it was used before in the town of Motaba, and nobody knows about it, is hard to believe. Are we to believe that nobody from Zaire know about this!? Did they do no research on where this disease, came from!? Come on! Also, how in the hell did the US able to bomb another African country's army base, anyways!? Wouldn't that be, an act of war!? Anyways, the idea of the military wanted to use Motaba, as a biological weapon should had been cut out, because adding an over the top stereotypical villain like Major General Donald McClintock (Donald Sutherland), really took away, some of the deadliness effects of the disease. For the last part, it felt like, a different movie, with the long-drawn helicopter chase, jumping into a moving ship, and hijacking a news outlet. It was eating a lot of time that could had made the disease even scarier. Despite that, the movie does have some very frightful moments. The idea that the disease was exposed to others in a movie theater, must had really scare those audience members who came to the theaters to see this movie. However, there is one scene that really disturbed me. All of the scenes with 'Sample 612' were haunting, due to how heartbreaking, it was. It made for a very intense watch. Overall: While, it does have a few flaws throughout the film. Don't avoided this film like the plague. Go see it. It might not be a great film, but it's entertaining enough to overlook it flaws.

This movie connects well because of recent world news concerning the Ebola virus and in that regard, the film is downright scary. One thing the film did was make sure I develop some healthy habits. That being said, this a fast-paced movie that has an incredible cast and a story that is well-written. My only qualm about the movie is the helicopter chases near the end, as I don't believe they fit the overall story arch.\n\nWolfgang Petersen's film is about how a fictional disease from Zaire called the Motaba runs rampant in a small California village. Now Colonel Sam Daniels and his CDC helpers must contain the virus before the virus spreads beyond the town's border.\n\nAs mentioned before, the film has a very talented cast. It's surprising how many Oscar-winners are in the cast. Dustin Hoffman does very well as Sam Daniels and the man who wants to save the lives of the sick. Rene Russo likewise does a good job as Sam's estranged wife and co-worker. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Sam's boss, the man who is stuck in the middle. We also get great supporting turns from Kevin Spacey and the villainous Donald Sutherland.\n\nOverall, Outbreak is an excellent movie that raises the question \"what if?\" If any town gets an outbreak of a deadly virus, would the government and the military take the same course of action as they did in this film? No matter which way you look at it, it's a very scary thought. The film, along with 2011's Contagion, are two worthy films to watch if you want to be scared the unconventional way. Because trust me, this film is scary because it could very well happen in reality. As for filmmaking, this is a very intense, well-made film.

It is a real treat of a movie to watch which not only acts as pure entertainment but also a deeply involving film which involves great performances and some real thrilling moments. It all starts with the wipe-out of an African village due to a deadly virus. However the virus is transported to the US by a small monkey which is smuggled by boat. The film then tracks along as more and more people get infected and the virus mutates making it airborne and more of a threat. \"It spreads like the flu\" The actors involved are Dustim Hoffman who as usual does an outstanding job. Rene Russo is used well as a love complication. Kevin Spacy is brilliant as the doctor with a sense of humour. Morgan Freeman and Donald Sutherland seem to be having fun with the material and things get interested when they clash at the end. The film, although thrilling at times (e.g a spectacular helicopter chase and an attempt to break out of the quarantined town) is extremely emotional as it does follow a few people as they are diagnosed with the virus. However, this is where the film also goes downhill a bit. We are expecting to see the chaos and mass panic of a virus infected town. However things seem abnormally calm, and I got fed up of main stars getting infected just to add to the pressure to Dustim Hoffman's character.\n\nBut overall this film is brilliant, I strongly advise everyone tries to watch this. it isn't everyone's cup of tea but is still a brilliant film which I will treasure and keep in my top 10.", "reviewTitle": "Brilliant stuff!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2005-06-17", "titleId": "/title/tt0114069/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "bob the moo", "userId": "/user/ur1002035/"}, "helpfulnessScore": 0.46952513198927426, "id": "/title/tt0114069/userreviews/rw0368833", "interestingVotes": {"down": 51, "up": 65}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "When a deadly virus decimates an African village, the US authorities attempt to draw a line under the incident and take the line that a reoccurrence is unlikely. However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.\n\nWhether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on \u0096 did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.\n\nEven with this section, the flaws are rife \u0096 the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation \u0096 the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature \u0096 having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clich\u00e9d lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.\n\nEven the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.\n\nAnother reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director \u0096 clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.\n\nOverall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending \u0096 one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it.

Oh, and don't forget that they somehow had the ability to create an antiserum to a deadly hemorrhagic virus in an hour. Amazing!

Warner Brothers shrugged its shoulders and decided to make a competing killer disease film NOT based on the book; and so they got together a script, director and cast as quickly as possible in the hopes of getting \"Outbreak\" to cinema screens first.  After a brief tussle Columbia realised the fight wasn't worth it, and backed out.  \"Crisis in the Hot Zone\" was never made.\n\nProbably a pity, for \"Outbreak\" shows every sign of being conceived in haste.  For a film about one of the most terrifying scenarios available - the new Black Death - it's surprisingly unfrightening.  Try to remain calm, is the tag-line.  You won't have to try very hard.\n\nThe screenwriters - and let's not blame them, since I suspect that they had but a single weekend in which to write it all - sprinkle the film with tiresome clich\u00e9s I won't bother to mention - not that this matters very much.  The real problem is that things are done just too easily.  By the end of the film Dustin Hoffman is leaping tall buildings in a single bound - which just makes us feel that the buildings couldn't have been so high, after all.\n\n(A side point: why, yet again, is the United States the only thing that matters?  The same new killer virus is already on the loose in Africa and could strike without warning elsewhere - why doesn't this worry anyone?)\n\nBasically this is another movie killed by undue haste.  The director does his job reasonably well, the dialogue is uninspired but not clunky, and Dustin Hoffman has enough charisma to keep us interested in his character, at any rate.  It's not really a bad movie.

Why? The answer is quite simple. We all know that diseases like Ebola and AIDS haven't always been among us, but that they were present somewhere on this planet. We don't know how it suddenly finds us, but it does. And since most of us are very scared of the unknown and we can be pretty sure that not everything has been discovered yet, movies based on this subject can be quite believable and scary.\n\nWhen a new deadly disease is discovered in Africa, Colonel Sam Daniels of the U.S. Army is sent to investigate it. As soon as he returns he warns his boss, General Ford, that they should put out an alert on this virus, even though it is far away from the USA and not airborne. General Ford refuses, since it is contained and unlikely to show up. But what both men don't know is that a monkey, carrying the deadly virus with him, has been captured and is being shipped to the USA, where a man who works at the customs house takes it and tries to sell it to a pet store. But when the sale isn't closed, the man doesn't know what to do with the monkey and releases it in the woods near a small town in California. A few days later the man collapses and dies in Baltimore and at the same time a new outbreak is starting in that little Californian town. Colonel Daniels, his team and his ex-wife will do anything possible to find a cure so they can save the population from being bombed by the military, but what they don't know is that there may have been a cure all along...\n\nOverall the story of this movie certainly isn't bad, but sometimes I started to find it all a bit too much. A new disease that mutates, that's possible. The army that wants to know more about it, there is nothing new about that. But than talking about military conspiracies, a president who wants to bomb his own people... that one I really didn't buy. And that's too bad, because I'm convinced that this could be a very powerful movie, if only they should have left out a couple of elements. Still, that's about the worst thing that I have to say about this movie. The acting for instance is OK. With people like Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland,... they have found themselves a very nice cast, which may well be the best reason why you should watch this movie, even when you aren't a fan of disaster movies (like me).\n\nBut not only the acting looks OK, so does the direction. With a man like Wolfgang Petersen, I immediately have some high expectations of course. He's the man that gave the world the ultimate submarine movie \"Das Boot\" and that always makes me hope for the best. Even though this movie never reaches to that extremely high level, it sure is better than average. The man still knows how to create the necessary tension and how to keep you interested. So, if it hadn't been for the not always so effective story, this movie would have scored very high on my list.

For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine.\n\nThe story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford.\n\nWhen the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released \"Contagion.\" The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. \"Outbreak\" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in \"Contagion.\" The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government.\n\nWhere \"Outbreak\" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase.

There is Viking tradition, there are interesting social and cultural differences between Northmen and others, there is vibrant Viking society and mainly, there is Ragnar; cunning Ragnar, who would \"give far more than his eye to acquire knowledge\". He is a man of progress, whose logic and wit wins against rigidity and stupidity. He is the man, who comes up with new ideas and surprises everyone who wants to defeat him. Finally, he is the only one capable of carrying this show and pushing it forward. \n\nThe third season is also pretty good, although it had slowed down a little bit, dragging the story slowly around, but who cares when Ragnar is going to raid the Paris whatever the cost! \n\nAs much I like the first three seasons, there is one thing that kept bothering me throughout second and the third one especially. Every time Ragnar kills some of his enemies (earl Haraldson, king Horik), he creates some kind of vacuum in the society he is not able to fill. Yes, he becomes earl and than king nominally, but he doesn't quite behave like one! I mean as Haraldson had been an earl, he had counselor Svein for the dirty stuff and his guard, he was a judge (in fact), blessed children etc. and all in all there was a lot of things happening around him in Kattegat. Not so with Ragnar; he is just kind of there, not ruling whatsoever, and sometimes it just feels like anarchy there, which I find not entirely plausible. Additionaly, as I have mentioned, there is a feeling of emptiness because of this, emptiness, which I am not quite able to describe. Maybe it is happening, because the second and third series already follows more story lines and can't concentrate on Vikings more, which is in my eyes a threat for this show.\n\nSeason 4 takes the good things from its predecessors - throws them away - and builds on flawed stuff of the first three seasons - which is emptiness, story distraction and fade-away from Ragnar. Starting with the most serious issue - Ragnar, it was perhaps the worst decision in the whole show to screw him up. For the entire season 4a, he feels old and tired, doesn't have any desire to explore and raid, doesn't care for his people and children much, and as if it wasn't already too bad, we have to watch him as he becomes a drug addict. This alone is just enough for me. The writers basically take the character majority of viewers cares about most and flush him into toilet. I know he must die eventually, but instead of seeing him suffering for about 9 hours (!!), it would be better to kill him off at his zenith.\n\nAnother issue, that hardly appeared in the first three series - there are many meaningless scenes which just kind of fill the time. Consider the whole Wessex feminist thing with Judith - so much time is wasted on her becoming tough and independent, but I don't see a reason why - this is something suitable for 20th century, not 9th. On the other hand there is not much explanation on key events such as why Rollo gave up on his manhood and turned into french nobleman and loving husband so easily.\n\nThe emptiness and anarchy I was talking about is really apparent in season 4. It is no more the king Ragnar and his people or the vibrant society from early seasons, it is a mixture of random characters with no depth being around. Typical ruling day of king Ragnar consists of throwing knives, ignoring everyone, doing crazy stuff and taking drugs in the shack, stalking on the rooftop and making a foreplay with that Chinese girl. Bj\u00f6rn tries to look as serious as possible, which makes his character so flat it makes me wonder about Ragnar's successor's ability to lead the show (I doubt any of the sons is capable of that). Than the whole thing with Erlendur's revenge is wasted, as everybody knows from the start Bj\u00f6rn will not die and Erlendur has even got no plan; when Kalf was still alive, there was a chance to take advantage of it, but now he wants to kill Bj\u00f6rn and then will see what's next, probably.\n\nI totally agree with others that it has become a soap opera. Consider king Finehair's arrival. It peaks at the end of an episode, when he basically says in front of everybody he wants to overthrow Ragnar, but that situation is not expanded in the next episode, which is typical for soap operas. Speaking of new characters, they are very uninteresting, and especially Yidu is a complete waste of time, and besides I find presence of a Chinese in the fjord disturbing, she just shouldn't be there; her only purpose is to be a drug dealer anyway. Then there is lot of uninteresting talking about family, children (everybody is with a child now, hearing this gives me an allergic reaction) and how it is being a father, which is just boring. And I can't help myself, but the families look like projections of 21th western family values - different from earlier seasons where we could see more freedom in sexual life and less sensitivity about children and death. Overall the episodes are too talkative and while basically nothing happens in most episodes, everything must have happened in the last one and it created a big mess, but I will not comment on that.\n\nFor me, Vikings end with the season 3 and the 4a just does not exist.

Just wish I'd ended when Ragnar left.\n\n#Spoilers below ...for those who have not seen season 5.5 stop now.\n\n**************\n\nSo now. The show has just lost all sense of its origins and purpose. I was really hoping to see Bjorn become a mighty warrior like his father and take up the mantel of Ragnar even if displaced by Ivar. Now he's just a pouty baby and screwing anyone in sight and dropped the mighty warrioress Torvi?! Wtf?! . And they shaved his freaking head and Alfred's hair cut WTAF?? They both look completely STUPID now. It's hard to take it seriously now at all. If anyone cut their hair it should have been UBBE! To shed his viking hair since it has religious and cultural significance but he is supposed to be Christian now so it would make sense for him. So why would mighty warrior Bjorn shave his instead?!\n\nThere are NO interesting or dynamic characters or situations whatsoever this season. They are all washed up and annoying. Ivar is just a crybaby lunatic. He has no reason for his \"madness\" and just looks like he is having a temper tantrum. And makes no sense why anyone would follow him and not just kill him in his sleep abd be done with his stupidity. Let's not even talk about the miserable failure of Floki and his flock. Good gracious is that a bore!\n\nJust put this show out of its misery or bring in tge writers and directors of season 1-3 or fire them if it's the same folks because they surely have lost their way!\n\nLast but not least why do these shows murder history for the sake of TV?! It's ok to take some license but geez to straight up stab holes in it all for literally NO reason is absurd. Keep stuff historically accurate whenever possible.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels.

Additionally, Starz bought 16 EPs rather than the usual 10, so that RDM has time to develop the story line and the many characters that appear in the book. The voice over takes some getting used to, since it's not a common practice today. So I refer back to the book again, because the reader is let into the lead character's thoughts most of the time - it's not all dialogue.

I found myself skipping scenes and fast forwarding a lot because it was boring and frankly, disturbing. \n\nI have nothing against sex, I think sex is awesome, and I realize this must sound terribly judgmental, but honestly watching this feels like I'm witnessing the secret fantasies of someone with a rather disturbed mind. This is not the kind of stuff I want to feed my consciousness with. \n\nAfter watching (or fast forwarding through) season 1, it's clear to me that I won't be watching season 2. \n\nMaybe I lacked patience with the series because I just couldn't get myself to like the character of Claire. She comes across to me as cold and annoying. Even when she's written to be kind and show compassion, she still feels cold to me. I also find her irritating. I tried to like her but just couldn't get myself to truly care about her. \n\nI love the supporting cast, though. I loved the character of Jenny, Jamie's sister. Those two have great chemistry. They're awesome as brother and sister! I also loved the other ones, Jenny's husband, Mrs. Fitz, and of course the hairy & rough Scots. They're all so likable. They're the ones who give the movies their soul and make them come alive. \n\nThe actor playing Black Jack Randall is so good that I felt scared every time he was on screen. I even wondered if the actor is a psychopath himself, to be able to play one so well. ;)", "reviewTitle": "Disappointing and Disturbing", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2016-04-07", "titleId": "/title/tt3006802/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "James_Denton", "userId": "/user/ur86987045/"}, "authorRating": 3, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5121546327070908, "id": "/title/tt3006802/userreviews/rw4616109", "interestingVotes": {"down": 32, "up": 52}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Outlander was a superb idea mixing excitement, adventure and romance with mystery and suspense, flitting between two periods in history through a mysterious stone circle.\n\nIt all started so well.

The over-long time spent on the Paris excursion didn't allow for some other important concepts to be covered. Season 3 only really had 3 decent episodes (1-3), but, again, the writing was lackluster and, in many episodes, downright silly. The much anticipated reunion episode was absolutely sophomoric from beginning to end. The writing was so bad, even the actors couldn't save the script, although the acting wasn't up to par anyway. In many episodes, Jamie seemed like a bystander on the sidelines. They also managed to make him look as unattractive as possible with that faded hair color and limp locks. The ridiculous \"recovery\" Claire made after drowning in the last episode was pathetic. By the end of Season 3, I seriously doubted that I'd bother with Season 4. The writers have managed to eliminate much of what was fun and interesting about the characters in Season 1 and created whiny, boring and unattractive characters by the end of Season 3. Some major casting errors (adult Fergus, Marsali, Brianna) added \"insult to injury.\" I just watched the Season 4 trailer and it appears they are using the same approach as Season 3. Too bad. What could have been a fabulous series year after year declined fairly fast. They've completely dropped the ball on this one, and I suspect that too many writers on this series have led to a lot of inconsistencies both with the story telling and with character development. I just finished watching two seasons another series (The Last Kingdom) and the difference is marked. Very good and consistent series, which had one writer for 14/16 episodes. That one writer has kept in mind not only what the characters and story is about, but just who the audience is. Outlander went from a story for adults to one for teenagers to one for old folks.

In season two he is almost destroyed again when, just for a moment, he believes he has lost not only his child, but also Claire's love. So far, in season three he has become physically smaller before our eyes. In episode one he begs for death. In episode two he cannot even look at the people he loves. He becomes almost concave\u2014a hollow empty man. And now, in the third episode he is an oppressed prisoner, his head down, his shoulders bowed, and at the same time, once again, a leader of men. Look at the difference in Sam Heughan's physicality at those different points in the story. He physically becomes a completely different man. Jeeze Louise, the guy is a good actor. He should be so proud of the work he's doing. I don't mean to minimize the work of the other cast members; they are all incredibly good at what they do. The difference is the issue of our assumptions about power and gender\u2014this is a story told by a woman, from a woman's perspective, and Diana Galbadon has taken a male character and shifted our expectations completely. Did any of us expect what happens to Jamie at the end of the first book or the first season? I don't think so. We live in a patriarchal culture; men are not treated like that, especially the hero of a story. And he is the classic hero. He has to go on a journey that he didn't choose for himself\u2014each decision he makes is the right thing to do at the time. He is the hero of the story. Claire is the heart. And Ronald D.

So much promise. So much rich story to explore, obviously a good budget, beautiful backdrop, the heroine meh but not un-watchable. \n\nI apologise in advance as die-hard fans of the books may not agree with me when I criticise some points, but bear with me since I didn't read the books, however this review is based on the TV series, obviously. If it differs from the books, then that's a different topic entirely.\n\nIn the TV series, Claire doesn't seem to give a damn about her husband and what she has left behind. How do you realistically get your head around time travel, falling into a barbaric situation, your husband left behind and out of his mind and the one thing you do is fall in love and lust! \n\nAnyway. The main issue is not any of this, actually. It's a much more serious issue. The rape scene in the prison. Obviously, the film makers wanted to make a huge impact, change society, create history and shoot ratings through the roof. And all other kinds of similarly un-selfish reasons.\n\nI would seriously like to ask all men. Gay, straight, trans, neutral, whatever you are. You are all fabulous and equal. But the question remains; would you enjoy a sexual experience and reach climax after being tortured, nailed through your hand, beaten to within an inch of your life, left so starving and thirsty that you get delirious, then raped absolutely so brutally that your you-know-where is probably ripped, blood is pouring from you, you can't move a limb, your whole body is screaming with pain and then - suddenly - you take pleasure out of it simply because you somehow manage to think of your wife while being sodomised a second time? \n\nWe all complain when women being raped is trivialized and we yell with rage when someone dares to suggest that a woman might actually enjoy rough sex. Thankfully, we have now evolved to also protest when gay sex is trivialized in the same way.\n\nBut I am quite shocked to see that all is very quiet with regard to this scene. Yes, there's a lot of outrage about homosexual rape, but only because people feel there was too much of it and it was too explicit. But I haven't seen any outrage by men, gay or straight, protesting that no human being would enjoy anything, least of a sexual encounter they are not partial to, after such extreme brutality. Forget the mindset, the sheer physiology makes it impossible. And this is what disturbed me the most. It is not rape that has been trivialized so much, it is sex itself. This show has degraded it, stomped on and whacked it so that it resembles nothing more than a crude fantasy of a media-hungry sadistic director.\n\nBasically, what we learn from this show, which got off to such a good start with such a good story and quickly went downhill thanks to Hollywood crassness, is that women are fickle, dumb and stumbling and will fall for the first hunk they see even if they have been thrown into a time where there is no flushing toilet, no hot water, a husband with whom passionate sex has just been had and is left behind and there's a muddy civil war on. As for the men, they can be alternately crass, violent and romantic yet instantly forgivable and despite being on the brink of death are so horny that they will get off on anything anytime. \n\nShame on the author for allowing this. And if she wrote it like this in her book, goodness knows what she thinks about the male species. Sub-humans who feel no pain and can be turned on in any situation?

After 4 episodes in on season 1 the characters sink into their roles and viewers get a feel for characters/story and become vested. Somewhere beyond season 4th season the show kinda declines into sporadic strategic misfiring that is just indicative to a lack of insight as to what the hardcore fans enjoyed about the series.\n\nThe show was built to be anchored around 2 characters (Carrie & Saul)... That's what made it soar in the beginning, but its also the show's biggest anchor and impediment.\n\nAdditional characters organically develop in this series like Brody & Quinn, and others that become powerful enough characters that draw viewers just as deep if not deeper than the planned formula of Saul/Carrie. This not only spices the show up but it relieves viewer fatigue of watching Carrier repeatedly go through her issues over and over in order to achieve interested dramatic effect.\n\nThese two major characters became critical and grew to carry this series to very new heights. Then the writers/produces irresponsibly ignore what these two characters brought to the show and it just seems writing/direction is forcefully introduced to steer the focus back to Carrie/Saul. And its very intrusive to the cohesiveness of the story and definitely leaves the audience feeling the show is become more artificial.\n\nThe other issue is that by removing both these characters the show is now VOID of any really \"Good guys\" leading characters... As time goes viewers learn both Brady & Quinn are the shows only seriously \"good guys\" on the show... They care and have a code of ethics way higher than Carrie or Saul. They are not perfect but have overwhelmingly redeeming qualities that make up for the bad. However, events really bring you to despise both Carrie and Saul for who they are. Viewers learn there is no loyalty and they both are ready to risk/do via force or manipulation to other good people under an illusion the risk is worth the reward...\n\nThey still personally believe they are good and do good overall but at their core nothing is sacred to accomplish what they need at all costs... and in the end both characters become sellouts to their own needs or masking it under many times very thin veil of country needs when it really was only for their personal interests.\n\nI think the writers had a good formula here but they are now seemingly forced to keep the story rooted in Carrie and Saul and that has left the show void of a real hero people can identify with as they could with Brody / Quinn...\n\nAnd the ridiculous writing on the demise of Quinn from the poisoning forward is amateurish at best and just shows the show is misfiring and not quite aware of what they fan base enjoyed about the program. Acting is super solid across the board... the only issue is maintaining the stories organic continuity and balance set aside some obvious cheese with Quinns repeated demises, and how they amateurly let a double agent station chief in Berlin run amuck in active operations even after they know she's a snowden level traiter and weakly convinces Dar Adal of otherwise...

Claire Danes plays an intense CIA analyst who believes that recently recovered P.O.W. (Damian Lewis) is plotting to attack America. Her character is unstable and makes it hard for the audience to believe her which adds to the beauty of the script.

Tight-knit, down-to-earth suspense with an actually realistic premise. As for the supposed \"propaganda\", it's time the people in the US hear what the rest of the world has been thinking for a decade now. No, really, we actually don't think it's absolutely ridiculous that 10 years of retaliatory wars in the Middle East will spawn some kind of blowback. This show explores what we've all been thinking, but American patriotism makes it shameful to admit. I find that incredibly strong and encouraging, and it makes me watch it not because I hate American, but because I enjoy and appreciate truth.\n\nAs for the acting, I sincerely hope Claire Danes will receive proper recognition. Especially in the last few episodes towards the end, her performance has been among the strongest on TV in years. Lately, only Brian Cranston's amazing tour-de-force in Breaking Bad has topped it. Damian Lewis, too, delivers like I've rarely seen. Far from the caricatures of Muslim terrorists Americans apparently would like to see, he sincerely and convincingly acts out the role of the man who is emotionally sure of what he wants, but not brainwashed enough to think is the absolute only way to achieve it.

The show is entirely made up of unlikeable characters. Literally all the main characters are annoying. The CIA agent is a completely unbelievable character that makes it virtually impossible to suspend your disbelief and get into the (weak) story. Her part is poorly acted and scripted and is probably the biggest turn-off of the series for me. Sergeant Brody is so dull, boring and often (again) unlikeable i am left not caring if he's turned or not, which seems to be the supposed mystery of the whole thing. There's very little story so far. It seems like every now and again, one of the main characters will start speaking Arabic (as if that in itself implicates them as a possible terrorist) which seems to be trying to serve as a \"twist\" to draw the series out. What seems to have been forgotten is you can't \"twist\" a story that isn't there yet! That said, anyone who thought Lost was good will probably think this is too, being seemingly of the same formula. I notice others compare Homeland unfavourably to 24. Personally, i'm not a fan of 24. but i can see why fans of that wouldn't like this. There's zero action in Homeland. I can only imagine the most paranoid and xenophobic of viewers really getting into this (which is probably why it won awards). I only gave this 3 rather than zero because i haven't seen it all.

Watching the last episode and seeing everyone's reaction to seeing each other again really hit home, and how you should appreciate the time you have because it goes by so fast.

I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. \n\nThis whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show. \n\nBut the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. \n\nI've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. \n\nAs for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. \n\nThis is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development.

Wilson deserved, at least, an Emmy nomination for his troubles. \n\nIf you dismiss the show out of hand then you will definitely be missing out on one of the best shows on TV right now.", "reviewTitle": "Blasphemy!

It has been (to me) one of the greatest American television shows for the past decade. A show that ran for nine years, The Office, touched the hearts and tickled the funny bones of Americans across the country and sadly concluded after nine seasons, not so long ago. Some say that the humor was dry and the emotions weren't real, but I am here to tell you otherwise.\n\nWhen The Office first launched it's pilot episode it received terrible reviews, leaving the cast to think that they wouldn't be returning for a second season. Of course this was a remake of the British version, which many viewers were comparing it to. What viewers really needed, was a chance to warm up to a show that was so different from average programs.\n\nWhat made The Office unique? Other than a cast ever so fantastically put together, The Office took an interesting television show perspective by having it set up as a \"documentary\" on the office employees. This way, the employees of the paper company, Dunder Mifflin, would know they were being filmed, and could even be interviewed individually from the rest of the office allowing the viewers to learn more about each interesting character.\n\nAt first glance, it doesn't look like much, but what TV show does? If you know nothing about a TV show then you will be quick to judge it, ruling it in your list to watch or marking it off. You can't look at The Office as just a comedy. Sure, there is an abundance of jokes and moments that will have you rolling over, but this show is about the characters and their relation to people like you and I. They don't kill people, live on the edge, become millionaires by selling drugs, or work as spy's for the government. They are people we can relate to, and in time you come to love them for who they are, far from perfect, yet fascinating in so many aspects. The drama, the hilarious awkward moments, the relationships, the disagreements, and general interaction between co-workers make this show what it is.\n\nFans all over the country have shared the laughs and the tears because they have had their own similar experiences. Just think about it...How do you get to know someone? You spend time with them, and over the last nine years I feel like I have spent time with every one of these amazing characters, played by incredible actors such as John Krasinski, Ed Helms, Steve Carell, Jenna Fischer, and Rainn Wilson, just to mention a few.\n\nThe Office is powerful enough to reach you in ways never before achieved by a television show. It makes you want to be there, in the office, with the employees, even if only for a moment so that you can have a feel of what it's like for yourself. The relationships feel real, the characters seem real, and whether you know a particular actor from other movies or shows, you'll only think of them as their office character after watching it.\n\nSo what's it about? The Office, seasons 1 through 7, feature Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who is a excellent salesman, but an ill-qualified idiot when it comes to managing a branch of a paper company. His heart is always in the right place and he cares for his employees, seeing them as his family, but his absent minded, luny self, prevents him from ever \"properly\" managing them. He is always procrastinating, causing office disturbances, wasting his employees time with senseless meetings, searching for his true love, and trying to be (in his mind) the best boss he can be. Though annoying to his employees half the time, Steve's character is a great guy who helped make the show such a success along with the other fantastic roles of every office member.\n\nNo two characters are alike, and that kind of diversity shouts success in my mind, because without character uniqueness, The Office wouldn't have become what it did. Characters of different beliefs, race, sexual orientation, senses of humor, and backgrounds showed the world just how well they could work through the rough times and continue to strengthen a bond that no force could penetrate. A bond felt by viewers for nine years and a bond felt by the characters and the actors playing them. A bond that only derives from The Office.", "reviewTitle": "Memes of The Office are mentioned on Facebook a lot", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-12-31", "titleId": "/title/tt0386676/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "bdale-90314", "userId": "/user/ur110963022/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5655185342473467, "id": "/title/tt0386676/userreviews/rw5313346", "interestingVotes": {"up": 5}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "The Office was a show that just had it all.

I found a link for the Myspace pilot. I started it, and it actually wasn't too bad. It really wasn't. I really enjoyed it. It was really good. One of the funniest bits was where Mr. Brown got the little card that said \"black\" (I won't go further than that, and the show didn't go too far into that anyways, but it was really funny just seeing that). To be honest, it was one of the most excellent Americanisations of a British shows. There were some great moments, like the east Indian woman coming back into the room and the boss going \"Hallo! Welcom to my stor! Vuld yu like sum gooki-gooki? Tri my gooki-gooki!\".\n\nHowever, I felt much of the time that the characters were rather lifeless. You couldn't really feel for them. They weren't as deep or real as the original BBC characters, to whom you could relate even if you'd never been in an office. The boss just wasn't good enough for what the original set the bar as (the David Brent character going down in history as \"most annoying boss\"), although he tries, really hard. One never really gets into Jim, who was originally Tim (good one, NBC). Pam (aka Dawn) isn't quite as well-played as Dawn's character. And the hideous syncophant (Gareth) has been replaced by a simply-annoying Dwight.\n\nBut what really makes the show a lifeless slug is the running time, which is barely twenty minutes. The whole thing seems far too rushed, and there just isn't enough material to satisfy the typical BBC-Office-watcher. The jokes aren't quite as good as the original, and there are so few of them. The pilot never really goes into anything, although the real show may prove different. However, a good feature in The Office is that NBC didn't spring for a laugh track, which would've ruined the show.\n\nAll in all, The Office is a feeble shadow of its British counterpart, but it still manages to please.", "reviewTitle": "Not as bad as I thought it would be, but...", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2005-03-24", "titleId": "/title/tt0386676/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "BobbyUK", "userId": "/user/ur11080235/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5498309613260307, "id": "/title/tt0386676/userreviews/rw1396631", "interestingVotes": {"down": 395, "up": 549}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Admittedly I absolutely adore the UK version (got both seasons on DVD) so was intrigued to find out what the US were capable of and, as of yet, only got to see the first three episodes of the US version.\n\nFirst the good points, the US version avoided the laughter track (which would have been the kiss of death) and still retained the dodgy camera-work (some people who hated this style seem to misunderstand that the comedy is supposed to reflect a fly-on-the-wall documentary and slick camera work is not a priority). At least, to some extent or other, the show retains some integrity to the original.\n\nHowever, I think one of the differences of the two shows (comparing is inevitable sorry)is how human these characters are. They are clearly flawed characters trying to get through life which gives an understanding as to why they are who they are. See, in the UK version of The Office, despite the ego and the manipulation you can almost feel the amount of pain David Brent goes through in his effort to impress people and feel comfortable being himself in his own skin. We can see Gareth Keenan's social inability and how his botched attempts at frustrated flirting end up as sexual harassment, Dawn Tinsley's stoic long-suffering, unsatisfying love-life and unfulfilled ambitions and Tim Canterbury's lack of confidence and fear of change to push forward to try and better himself are all poignantly on show in very subtle ways.\n\nThe US version seemed to reduce itself to a set of stock characters. For example, Michael looks too conventional and his part is played too one-dimensionally for his role to work so he appears just stupid and nerdish rather than looking beyond the eager to please ego to find a man constantly seeking validation underneath the delusions of grandeur. Jim seemed far too cool and confident and in control of his surroundings to really endure the pangs of anxiety when office chaos occurs and Dwight just seems like a nasty piece of work as with Gareth you could tell he was overcompensating for his own insecurities. Yes, different shows perhaps but some things needed to stay the same for the humour to work. \n\nI also think the Pam/Jim romance was overdeveloped too soon. There didn't appear to be internal struggles going on between them so when they were to realise each other's feelings for each other the pay-off would be considerably smaller (in the first episode alone Pam was humorously embarrassed by Jim's ability to guess her favourite yoghurt flavour - corny at best, lol).\n\nThe fact that the US actors seem like they are acting badly rather than normal everyday people acting up in front of the camera doesn't go in it's favour either.\n\nThe UK version thrived on the fact that you were going to feel very uncomfortable watching the show, that was the genius behind it. The long protracted silences, the embarrassing events, the over-inflated egos getting their bubble's pricked time and time again all completely lost in the US version. The pace was also deliberately quickened too (probably to keep time with adverts) so hitting the pain barrier was kept to a minimum and therefore the effect was lost. It gives me the impression that the US producers were scared that if it got too uncomfortable to watch that the audience couldn't handle it and therefore would be turned off...a shame really.\n\nAll in all, at least the US are attempting to make a show that isn't frightened to deal with everyday average people in an everyday environment but it has a long way to go yet. I still can't decide whether we English overall are too sadistic as a nation or whether the Americans have accepted mawkish sentimentality as the norm but one thing for sure, this show in both versions displays how a situation can be interpreted in two entirely different ways by two totally different countries.", "reviewTitle": "Humour is a funny thing . . .", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2006-06-18", "titleId": "/title/tt0386676/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "J49afc", "userId": "/user/ur101602797/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5481460512166723, "id": "/title/tt0386676/userreviews/rw4777483", "interestingVotes": {"down": 3, "up": 12}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Where do I begin with this wonderful show?\n\nWhat is the single most important thing in one's life?

The Jim and Pam story remains my favourite part of the show. Their story was so well written that it seemed as if they were meant to be together, a real testament to the chemistry the cast had with each other. It is hard to consider anyone else as the greatest TV couple of all time.\n\nAnd when it wants to jerk a few tears, it does so without warning. I had never cried at any TV show or movie before watching this show. Jim and Pam's wedding, Michael's goodbye, the list goes on. And I haven't even mentioned the Finale. It was nothing short of perfection. It tied together the show perfectly with the characters reminiscing about 9 years of their lives together before going their separate ways. It too left me reminiscing about the time I had spent following the lives of the employees of Dunder Mifflin and thinking about how I'd never see them again. Again, it comes back to the relatability of the characters- It really made me feel like I was saying my final goodbyes to friends I was never going to see again- something that made me cry floods of tears.

Firstly that we're not being overlooked for London, Manchester or Liverpool, and we're being allowed our own history, which is interesting and colourful.\n\nAt first glance the downstairs of the Shelby house looks too big to be the ground floor of a terrace, and people seem to be using their front doors far too often which, since there seems to be a significant amount of 'respect' being shown and rules being followed, it irks me that this protocol's being ignored. That said, it does look better to have the character using the front door.\n\nMy other issue is accents. In fairness, for the most part people are doing an amazing job - most real Brummy accents do not sound like the caricature most people think of, and this is being respected by the actors with only the occasional slip... except for Aunt Polly. Helen McCrory is a fine actress - a mistress of the Brummy accent she isn't. Her performance is making up for it however.\n\nThe Jamaiacan preacher amused me; as pointed out by another reviewer this actor is Benjamin Zephaniah: B'ham local and poet. Jamaica did send help over for WWI, so it's not impossible that several men stayed. He is a wonderful reminder that Birmingham has always been a hub for migration - even more so after WWII.\n\nSam Neill's performance is amazing.\n\nSo far the series is not just telling an interesting story, it's telling elements of Brummagem's history and present in a subtle and interesting way.

They give these spooks a face and then send Dean and Sam to blow them to smithereens. \n\nWhile the coated focus is naturally the supernatural, the deep artery of the show is the love between these brothers as they sort out their past and arguments with \"Dad\" and challenge their future with a new light.

Fans of lore and legends will eat up \"Supernatural\" without a second thought, and come back for seconds. From Demons to the Devil himself, this show has got it all. Here is a small introduction to the series, to all of you newcomers.\n\nSupernatural is the story of two brothers, older bro Dean Winchester (played by the sexy, fantastic actor Jensen Ackles, who would be known from shows/movies such as My Bloody Valentine and Dark Angel) and younger bro Sam Winchester (played by the just-as-sexy-and-fantastic actor Jared Padalecki, known from his role as Dean on Gilmore Girls) being trained to hunt and kill supernatural beings by their father, John (played by Jeffery Dean Morgan of P.S. I Love You and Grey's Anatomy, on which he played the memorable character Denny). Years before the series takes place, John's wife, Mary, woke up to the sound of baby Sam crying over the baby monitor. She peeked into his room to see a figure,presumably John, standing by the crib. She left the room, but on her way back to bed she heard the Television downstairs. She walked down to see John watching TV. Noting this, Mary ran back up to Sam's room only to find a yellow-eyed demon standing over her baby boy. Seconds later, she was dragged onto the ceiling with a large, bloody gash in her stomach. John, hearing a commotion, quickly made it to the room, only to see blood dripping into Sam's crib and Mary on the ceiling. Before he could react, the room burst into flames. John had Dean take Sam outside while he tried to save his wife, to no avail. The house was destroyed, Mary was dead... and John had no where else to go. After that day, he swore vengeance on the Yellow Eyed Demon, and he took his sons along for the ride.\n\nFlash forward to 22 years later. Sam is now in college, preparing for an interview at Stanford University to study Law. He is with his long-time girlfriend, Jessica. Late during the night before his interview, Sam awoke to a sound of someone in the house. After a brief struggle with the intruder, he realized it was his brother, who has been away with John for years. Dean tells Sam that their father has been missing for a while on a 'hunting trip;' a hunt for supernatural monsters, that is. After a very unexpected turn of events (which I will not state, for it will spoil some things), Sam reluctantly joins his brother on the search. The \"Supernatural\" series begins here.\n\n\"Supernatural\" goes beyond the unexplained, hitting everything from a paranormal spirit haunting a house to the war between God and Lucifer's army, along the way meeting creatures such as the hilarious and uncalled-for Trickster, a Valentine's Day Cupid, shape-shifters, werewolves, vampires and even angels.\n\n\"God? Does this show turn religious on us?\" No.\n\nStarting in season 4, you are introduced to Lucifer, God and the angels. But, the thing is, it is definitely not what you expect from it. the lore of angels and demons is kept in parts and completely thrown on its head at others. God isn't necessarily the 'God' you know, and neither is Lucifer for that matter. They don't show the devil in the traditional way, with red skin, a pitchfork and horns. He looks like a human being. A very creepy and sadistic human being, but a human being nonetheless.\n\nWhich brings me to what I like most about the show. The effects. Many shows on television use a crap-ton of CGI (computer generated imagery) to make their monsters. Supernatural, although a fair amount of CGI is present, uses makeup effects and short cuts to get away from the bad-looking CGI beasts. Hellhounds, for instance, are invisible to the human eye. You can hear them and feel them, but you can't see where they are. Demons are large wisps of black smoke that enters a human to possess, at which point the eyes of said human turn completely black. The demons can hide the blackness to get into different areas of society without being noticed. These little alterations make the show worth watching. You don't get the cheesy looking CGI characters that most Sci-Fi shows do a poor job on due to budget and time. You get creepy, evil beasts and creatures that can scare the daylights out of you.\n\nOne more thing I ought to mention is the unfathomably amazing season finales this show puts on. Seriously. Yes, the storyline and the relationship between the brothers keeps you interested, but once you get to the finale of a season, you automatically want to watch the next. Every season has a perfect cliffhanger that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Summers are a very hard thing to get through with this show.\n\nAll in all I have to rate this show a 10 out of 10. I can't seem to find anything to fix. The acting of Jared and Jensen as the brothers is fantastic. Their moods and actions are perfect, and you could seriously believe they were real-life bros (likely due to the fact that they are best friends). The storyline is extremely well-written and perfectly paced. The dark and terrifying episodes are balanced out by the humorous ones that leave you laughing until your stomach hurts. Everything about this show is worth noting, but I can't say it all. I'll leave the rest up to you.\n\nNow stop reading my rant about this show and GO WATCH IT.", "reviewTitle": "\"Supernatural\" is easily one of the most creative, addictive, intense shows on TV", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2011-04-24", "titleId": "/title/tt0460681/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "sarastro7", "userId": "/user/ur2950235/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7885078003251231, "id": "/title/tt0460681/userreviews/rw1183103", "interestingVotes": {"down": 103, "up": 475}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "After being disappointed by mediocre to bad new shows like Threshold  and Invasion, I am glad that there's at least one new show that really  delivers.

A long way Supernatural and myself have done over the years so the news about ending the show with 15th season get to me more than I could imagine.\n\nAs a horror and mythology lover, it didn't took long for this show to get my attention. Leading actors are great, they gave their characters so much life and it is really easy to bond with Winchester/Casstiel gang (except Mary Winchester - she never really had that spark, but I blame writers for not giving her better story) . You know how the friends are becoming friends? You just spend enough time with those people and if you have any mutual interests, you are becoming friends after time. Supernatural is not masterpiece by any means, but those characters crawl under your skin over the years, so ending the show is like watching your good friend leaving for good.\n\nPersonally, I really recommend this one here if you are into demons, angels, ghosts, ghouls and a touch of a family drama. Great horror-fantasy with some comic relef and at some times really cheesy but you will be entertained all the way through if you are into any of those. And soundtrack!

I enjoyed season 8 and how the main villain of that season was actually smart, but I do not like how it ended. When Lucifer was introduced into the show I got hyped, because he's the actual devil and became my absolute favorite character. RIP Lucifer. I hated when Jack was born. How he acted and how he went evil was really dumb. Now, Chuck AKA God. He didn't seem that much of a bad guy to me. Yes, he left them to suffer. Yes, he didn't help almost at all, but he didn't seem like the God to start the Apocalypse because something didn't go his way. Super hyped for the next season and the End of the Winchesters.

I think I remember it being briefly mentioned in an article about new fall shows, but as soon as I read that it was going to be airing on the WB, I didn't give it a second thought.\n\nAfter the first episode aired, a friend of mine who shares a lot of my same tastes in TV told me that I should check it out. I was skeptical, but it was being rerun in a couple of days so figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a chance.\n\nAnd boy am I ever glad I did! This show is everything I've ever wanted in a TV show. It's suspenseful, the characters have depth, it's funny without being silly, it has a touch of campyness (but not enough to be ridiculous). Not to mention that the two leads are quite easy on the eyes! The strongest element of the show by far is the two leads, Jared Padalecki (Sam) and the phenomenal Jensen Ackles (Dean--who is easily one of the most compelling and likable characters I've seen on TV in a long time). They play brothers who had been separated for a few years when the search for their missing father brings them back together. They grew up hunting supernatural beings with their father so they travel across the country fighting evil things that get in their way.\n\nDean and Sam have excellent on screen chemistry and a dynamic that really works for a show like this. It's important for a show like this, with only two leads (and really no supporting characters yet) that the two leads be interesting and complex enough both together and on their own to keep people interested in the show. The creators have hit the ball out of the park with Dean and Sam.\n\nDean and Sam each bring their own strengths and weaknesses and each have their own crosses to bear. Dean still remembers his mother (who is shown in a flashback being brutally murdered by an unknown evil force) who died when he was a small child so he understands the reasoning behind his father's crusade. Sam is haunted by the death of his girlfriend (coincidentally--or not--killed in the exact same manner as their mother) which was the catalyst for him joining Dean in the search for their father, in the hopes that Dad has found out something more about whatever killed the most important women in his life.\n\nEvery episode has a \"Evil-Thing-of-the-Week\" so to speak which the boys must discover and figure out how to kill. Most of these things spring from myths or urban legends (ie. the wendigo, Bloody Mary).\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised with this show, and after only five episodes, I have to say it has surpassed the many other shows I enjoy and is now #1 on my list of favorite current TV shows.\n\nIt has a nice old school X-Files feel to it (not surprising, since several people who worked on X-Files created and write for this show), which I absolutely love, as X-Files is definitely my all time favorite show.\n\nIf you like the paranormal and want to see great characters you can really care about, check out \"Supernatural\", I guarantee you will not be disappointed.", "reviewTitle": "My new favorite show", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2005-10-13", "titleId": "/title/tt0460681/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Clive_W", "userId": "/user/ur30888832/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6860596904170214, "id": "/title/tt0460681/userreviews/rw5034959", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 17}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Supernatural is a hell of an accomplishment to get up to 15 season, now I must admit I fell out the loop on the show round maybe season 10, I couldn't actually say, to be fair this show is just great to have on in the background or if you just want to enjoy a little escapism, you can see and feel the actors having a good time, and everyone knows or has heard how good friends the cast are off set.

Its stars are an intrepid duo who travel across America encountering all manner of paranormal phenomena and mythological creatures. It has a lot of ex-files staff too which is apparent if you have watch both shows pretty closely.\n\nSupernatural isn't as smart as The X Files , nor is it as cleverly written. The X Files was ahead of the time in many ways and is still unique in others, in that it was a mature drama which took its subject matter very seriously. It managed to blend sci fi and the paranormal skillfully so that you almost didn't notice the seams. Supernatural in a way is like The X Files - lite. It knows what it is and I think is a more focused show then its predecessor. From the get go it lays it out to you that it is situated in a world where ghosts, demons and witches really do exist. Once that is established its on with the show and there is no looking back whereas the X Files constantly had the viewer questioning and thinking about what he was seeing and hearing. Where The X Files was the thinking mans science paper, Supernatural is a camp fire ghost story.\n\nWhich is more then fine by me. As a lover of ghost stories myself Supernatural makes for fantastic viewing. Its strongest points are its atmosphere and visual imagery. The storyline surrounding the brothers relationship to their father and to each other is in its fledgling stages and will no doubt become stronger over time. Already though it is fun to watch the interplay between Dean and Sam. being the older brother in a family of two myself I find myself sympathising with Dean. Not just because of that but also because I find his personality something I can relate to. His is very Mulder-like in his often whimsical approach to situations. The other brother Sam I find downright annoying at times with the overplayed teen angst.\n\nAs for the story lines themselves this is Supernaturals weakest point. So far in the first series Supernatural has a basic structure which rarely changes - brothers drive into town, weird things (usually deaths) happen, brothers use fake ID's to find out about the demon / witch / ghost just in time to save the Hot Chick of the Week(tm) wash, rinse, repeat. If it continues Supernatural is in danger of burning out real fast. However in latter episodes there looks to be some sort of mythology developing which should hopefully complicate things. The fathers connection to their mothers death, Sams visions, the Meg demon etc.\n\nHaving just criticised the story lines I have to admit I love their themes. Each week focuses on a different legend such as the woman in white, bloody mary, vampires etc. Each handled very well and with a surprising amount of knowledge. You can tell that ghost story telling is a real labour of love for the creators. It also introduces a lot of lesser known legends such as the wendigo, shrika etc. Someone is doing their homework and I cant wait to see what creatures appear in later episodes. The references to other supernatural shows such as the x files and ghostbusters is an added treat for fans of the genre. As is the classic rock soundtrack. My god someone has taste. Its like they reached into my mind and put down all my favourite past times on celluloid. Well the ones that can be viewed by under 18's anyway. I wouldn't say Supernatural has \"made scary sexy\". I would say its made scary cool again. If only I could be cool again too. Maybe I would be if I had a Chevy Impala too.\n\nAll in all an excellent new series dripping with humour, atmosphere and chills.

Jared and Jensen are placed in roles they are familiar with, Jared is playing Sam, a character who seems to be a tougher version of Dean, his character from the Gilmore Girls. Jensen is playing Dean, a character who is extremely close to being a human clone of his sarcastic character from Dark Angel, Alec. Opening a WB show with such great effects scores big with me- not giving anything away, the special effects are what Nutter and his team are capable of. Sarah Shahi as a guest star was icing on the cake. The only problem I see with the show is the fact that it is not geared towards the main demographic of the OC and Gilmore Girls (which airs in the time slot before Supernatural) and it may turn away a group of older viewers who may really enjoy it. As long as they don't call it the \"teen X-Files\" or \"Buffy meets Twin Peaks\" it will be fine.

Welcome to the most divisive movie of the year. Some will scoff at the idea and deride the filmmaker without ever even seeing the movie. Some will relay disgust after seeing the movie. A few won't appreciate the style or structure, and will fail to find the humor. Ah yes, but some of us will embrace Taika Waititi's wacky adaptation of Christine Leunens' 2018 novel \"Caging Skies\" as one of the funniest and most heart-warming films of the year ... fully acknowledging that many won't see it our way.\n\nOne wouldn't be off base in asking why a successful filmmaker would tackle such a risky project: a coming-of-age comedy-drama-fantasy about a 10 year old Nazi fanatic who has as his imaginary friend, not a 6 foot rabbit, but the Fuhrer himself, Adolph Hitler. After all, writer-director Waititi is coming off a couple of brilliant indies (2014's WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and 2016's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) and a major score with Marvel money on THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), arguably the most entertaining superhero movie of the past few years. He certainly could have continued to cash in with 'safer' choices; however, Mr. Waititi sees the world differently than most of us. He finds humor in the drudgery, and humanity in malevolence. He's also a bit goofy.\n\nPlaying over the opening credits is the German version of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", as we see old clips of German citizens cheering for Adolph Hitler in a similar manner to how fans used to scream for The Beatles. World War II is nearing the end as we meet 10 year old Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo is fervent in his fanaticism towards the Nazi way, and buys into the belief that Jews are monsters with horns on their head. He's such a believer that his imaginary friend is actually Hitler, well at least a bumbling boisterous version played by the filmmaker himself - enacted to extreme comedy effect (recalling a bit of Chaplin in THE GREAT DICTATOR). Mel Brooks managed to play Hitler to a laughable extreme in \"Springtime for Hitler\" in THE PRODUCERS, but the only thing missing her from Waititi's costume is an old timey dunce cap.\n\nJojo lives at home with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while dad is off fighting on the front line. Ms. Johansson's performance is terrific (despite limited screen time) as she creates a believably warm bond with her son during horrific times. Soon, Jojo is off to a Nazi camp designed to teach the boys how to fight (and burn books), as the girls learn the virtues of having babies. The camp leaders are Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who is a bit of a joke on the surface, but more interesting the deeper we dig; Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who boasts of having 18 Aryan babies; and Finkel (Alfie Allen) a violent psychopath. At camp with Jojo is his best friend Yorki (newcomer and scene-stealer Archie Yates), and the two show what a genuine friendship can be as the movie progresses.\n\nThings change quickly for Jojo when, by happenstance, he discovers a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home. Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, LEAVE NO TRACE) shows none of the characteristics that Jojo has been brainwashed into believing all Jews possess. She has no horns, flashes a good sense of humor, and is actually very nice and knowledgeable. In other words, she's no monster. As they get to know each other, Jojo realizes this \"nice\" Jewish girl contrasts starkly with his lunatic hero Adolph.\n\nWaititi's film is ingenious satire, and it likely won't sit well with those who think not enough time has passed to justify making fun of Nazi atrocities. It's funny and heavy, and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way. The \"Heil Hitler\" count approaches the 'F-word' frequency of most Tarantino movies, and there is a German Shepherd gag that caught the audience off-guard. Stephen Merchant's Gestapo search of Jojo's house is comedy at its weirdest. The movie messes with your head as it's some odd blend of SCHINDLER'S LIST, \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", and an extended Monty Python skit.\n\nIt's rare for a film that borders on slapstick at times to have so many touching and emotional moments. The actors are really strong here, especially Ms. Johansson and Ms. McKenzie, who as gutsy Elsa, proves again she is quickly becoming a powerhouse young actor. Roman Griffin Davis carries a significant weight in the story despite being a first time actor, and I can't emphasize enough how young Archie Yates will steal your heart while he's stealing his scenes. Michael Giacchino's score and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's terrific cinematography work well with Waititi's vision ... a satirical vision that would never work outside of his unique filmmaking talent. The story is basically proof of the adage, 'Kill 'em with kindness', when what we are really killing is hatred. At its core, this is a story of humanity and human nature, and how we grab hold of the wrong thing until the truth becomes evident.

Taking him back to his bittersweet indie roots, his storytelling and humanity shows through at every moment. A story of a 10 year old nazi youth in full swing of his country's ideology indoctrination, he starts his journey with his invisible best friend Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi himself) going off to Hitler Youth camp. His mother is a wild and endearing woman with a playful attitude during this horrible time of war. The movie starts off hilariously, but it takes a little bit of time to allow yourself to feel okay laughing at this side of the german war and this little boy who wants nothing more than to do right by his fuhrer. After a terrible (and hilariously acted) accident, and the discovery that his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic, his ideals are turned upside down to the thoughts on the war he has grown up with. It's a simple message delivered in a way that tells you what you already know. Facism is bad. It's a story that Taika tells us needs to be told over and over again, because people easily turn a blind eye to the horrors of humankind, but heart and love can prevail. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are a great pair and carry the film with warmth and wonderful comedic scenes, but it's Scarlett Johansson who leaves us with the memory of what it means to be on the right side of humanity, and to take life as it comes and teach your children what you can, when you can. Even surrounded by well-known and substantial actors, these two children stand out and bring the movie's warm embrace. Taika is never afraid to lead with a joke, but he always takes the time to bring his message of humanity home by hanging on the sad moments of life too, not jumping over life's tragedies to get to the next one-liner.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's \"kind\", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a na\u00efve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first.", "reviewTitle": "A heartfelt satire needed for today", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-09-18", "titleId": "/title/tt2584384/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "gorgos19", "userId": "/user/ur23130753/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6257829268109794, "id": "/title/tt2584384/userreviews/rw5222298", "interestingVotes": {"down": 71, "up": 157}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "As a German, I loved everything about this movie.

If you think the synopsis sounds crazy, you have no idea what you're in for...\n\nThough seemingly taking inspiration from the works of Wes Anderson and Mel Brooks, \"Jojo\" manages to create something in an entirely new ball park pulling off a spoof that manages to be hilarious while not disrespecting its touchy subject matter, a feat that only the wonderful Taika (who directed, wrote and acted as Imaginary Hitler in) could pull off so well. The film also boasts some killer cinematography as well as a wonderful soundtrack, both of which punctuate some of the films quieter moments to ground us in the era and atmosphere of the film.\n\nAs mentioned above, Taiki plays the titular boy's imaginary Hitler friend and leaves you weak in the stomach from laughing so much - he's, quite simply, hilarious. And yet, he doesn't manage to overpower the rest of the cast which includes Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Jo and Rebel Wilson all of whom are wonderful. But most notably, it's the child performances that take center stage. The two little leads are incredible, making us laugh at times, shed a tear at others and just feel for the two of them. Their comedic timing, range and overall performances are done to a T - it's because of them the film works as well as it does.\n\nIn today's day and age, more than ever, people need a reason to just sit back and smile and this makes \"Jojo Rabbit\" a truly timely film. Leave it to Mr. Waititi to take one of the most gruesome periods in human history and, believe it or not, find both a humour and beauty in its telling. It's also entirely original in its execution and is perhaps the perfect example of the kind of film Hollywood could use more of. All that's left to say is thanks for the laughs Taika; and for your brilliantly twisted mind!", "reviewTitle": "Inventive, hilarious and original - \"Jojo\" is a ballsy film that works because of its wit and heart - 8/10 \u2b50", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-09-16", "titleId": "/title/tt2584384/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "bahduggi", "userId": "/user/ur58085330/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5178909731190222, "id": "/title/tt2584384/userreviews/rw5247058", "interestingVotes": {"down": 48, "up": 74}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Truly marvelous performances, and a story worthy of your time, expertly spun.

It has a ton of comedy both light and very dark! Don't be fooled, though. This is less The Producers or Look Who's Back and more Life is Beautiful. There are some seriously heavy and tragic parts in this movie that I don't dare spoil here. While it is a commentary about how childish the whole idea of Naziism is, it is also about the horrors of indoctrination and intolerance and the damages they can inflict. Great performances, beautiful costumes and cinematography and with a brilliant script, this is a must-see!

He decides to go on a weekend for fellow brainwashed enthusiasts. However, after a (very funny) accident with a grenade he finds himself hospitalised. At home recovering he discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. He confides this to his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (!)\n\nThis film is actually a comedy! An off the wall, zany and irreverant comedy that works beautifully. It was a massive gamble to make such a film in such oversensitive and 'woke' times. And it was Disney of all studios that made Jojo Rabbit! Should such a terrible period from history be depicted in such a chirpy and comical way? Should Hitler be portrayed as such a goofball within the film? YES! Whether it's Mel Brooks (who said he loved JoJo Rabbit) with The Producers and it's musical Springtime For Hitler or Joan Rivers making her controversial joke about the Holocaust on Fashion Police, humour reaches the parts that more earnest and serious pieces of 'art' can't. It forces you to laugh at whatever is the target of the joke is and then analyse why you laughed at something that you normally wouldn't see as comical.\n\nWhilst most critics have lauded the film, there are peripheral pundits who have either said that the filmmakers have gone too far (How dare they make a comedy starring Adolf Hitler?!) or that they didn't go far enough (How dare they make a film about Nazi Germany and not show the full horror of what happened?!). The Guardian hated the film which is another reason for audiences go and see this gem of a film.\n\nBut, understandably, everything depicted in the film isn't just for laughs. There are plenty of gut-wrenching moments when the full horror is brought home to the characters and audience alike. These poignant sequences aren't milked for all their worth and this makes them all the more powerful and genuine. There were a couple of pivotal scenes which made me fight back tears. These scenes were played out for what they were without the whole film descending into a tissue-soaking cry-a-thon which would have cheapened and devalued the movie's content.\n\nThe film also looks beautiful with set designs and a colour palate that makes Jojo Rabbit a feast for the eyes. This film is beautifully constructed. Jojo's room, the house in which he resides, the cubby hole that houses Elsa and the surrounding environs are all aesthetically pleasing and a joy to behold.\n\nAlso, check out the framing. Every scene feels just as quirky, off-kilter and as warped as the narrative. Watch out for the scene on the giant steps and the later scene with it's emphasis on a character's shoes and how this motif is used later on in the film in an extremely heartbreaking but dignified and tasteful way.\n\nThe soundtrack is also fantastic with The Beatles' German language version of I Wanna Hold Your Hand ('Komm, gib mir deine Hand') and Bowie's Helden leading the way. In fact, these two rather obscure (to English eyes anyway) versions of well known songs normally heard in their Mother Tongue depict the whole feel of the film- off kilter, eschew and very original.\n\nThere are uniformly amazing performances by the likes of Roman Griffin Davis playing Jojo, Scarlett Johannsen as his mother, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa the Jewish hideaway and Sam Rockwell (great to see him taking more risks with his choice of roles after starring in the ultra-woke and unbearable Three Billboards). Also, look out for Stephen Merchant as a very sinister Nazi inspector. He reminded me of The Demon Headmaster. But it's director and screenwriter Taika Waititi who plays Adolf Hitler who steals the show. Every scene that hes in is comedy gold as he depicts Hitler as a kind of bro/dude best friend to Jojo. His lines and mannerisms are laugh out loud hysterical.\n\n4 parts humour, 1 part sentiment, this film has a power that will seep into your brain during it's running time and stay with you long after the film is over. In fact my first thought on leaving the cinema was that I wanted to see it again.\n\nI feel privileged to have seen one of the best films of 2020 on Jan the 1st of this year.

He should not be allowed to write alone.\n\nThe material he had to work with in bombshell had every opportunity to be engaging, however it was horribly executed with maybe 1 good scene of tension and drama. There is a cautionary foremessage about the presence of dramatisation in the movie. There is no way the movie is less boring than the real events that occurred.\n\nNo character was given any depth, with the only distinguishing feature being the A-list actor in the part. Randolph could not choose a focus for the story, not any of the characters or even the main issue was followed to any significant degree; instead, the movie diverts to unnecessary tangents about what our characters are up to in their personal lives in what I can only assume was an attempt to humanise the cardboard cutouts. I couldn't care for any of the characters.\n\nBy an acting standpoint, I managed to spot 3 good actors, Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie and John Lithgow. Lithgow's performance was genuinely engaging as was most of Theron's. The few Australian accents in the movie from the Murdoch family were laughable as they parkoured between British, American and have-heard-of-Australia levels of accuracy.\n\nMaybe in an earlier draft of the script Kate McKinnon served a purpose, Bill O'Reilly was more than a name or Margot Robbie wasn't reduced to an extended cameo, but these are only some of the useless elements that made this movie feel an hour longer than it was.\n\nThematically, the story is hollow, with the only thing the movie says is 'sexual harassment bad', delivering a message beyond safe, that it barely registers as a message. Randolph was unable to even fully commit to any political view on such a significant event, with certain scenes trying to be apolitical and political, displaying anti-trump notions whilst emphasising the reliability and integrity of Fox News, with only a slight left lean, leaving the story forgettable. (The Trump sections were played as cute references?) However, seeing how it reflects my political ideology, it must be good 10/10.\n\nBut wait. Isn't it hypocritical for such a big Hollywood movie to condemn sexual harassment whilst also practicing a far more toxic culture than a Fox News office? No because the movie is anti-sexual-harassment, so I think they learnt their lesson.\n\nThere were very few scenes of significant CGI use, but boy were those 2 scenes very distracting. An actor on a roof looked like they were floating, with surrounding buildings and rooftop antennae looking less real than their wigs, and an actor was not well composited into archive footage.\n\nConsider me thoroughly disappointed.

It balances the almost comic feel it has with serious moments and intentionally uncomfortable ones.

Perhaps the single most uncomfortable scene in the film involves Kayla as Roger insists she lifts her dress to show him her legs, urging her to go higher and higher as television is a \"visual medium.\" It's the type of scene that would be uncomfortable in and of itself but Robbie portrays Kayla's clear distress masterfully and the feeling is heightened once again when you consider that this sort of stuff has happened in real life to real people. The film also spotlights casual sexism and objectification as the women working for Fox are told to wear short dresses and aren't allowed to wear pants. Most of the 'compliments' they receive are about how sexy they are rather than their skills as a journalist.\n\nAs well as a commentary on the sleaziness of higher ups in corporations, it also celebrates the courage shown by people like Carlson who speak up even when they know it could cost them everything. Theron displays her characters inner conflict brilliantly, working up to the stage where she's ready to speak out too. There's tension in the air and the camera-work adds to this with rapid cuts and dramatic zooms throughout.\n\nBombshell is a great movie standing alone but a movie that also feels relevant in this #MeToo era.

This film feels more like a tool to showcase how corporations have been run in the past, but there wasn't enough depth to really dive in. Filled with great performances and a true story worth exploring, here's why I believe Bombshell is one big missed opportunity.\n\nThis film follows a few main characters, but the centrepiece of this story is the fact that Roger Ailes would sexually harass women in order to give them higher positions at Fox News. He did this for years and many of these women kept silent in order to keep their jobs. If this film is accurate, Gretchen Carlson was the first one to speak up and many began to follow her lead. There is a lot of information and many insightful moments that kept my attention, but this film severely suffers from relying on those two things. More than anything, Bombshell wants to get messages out, but the pacing was slow and it felt like I was watching a newspaper article unfold on-screen.\n\nCharlize Theron as Megyn Kelly was a show-stopper, Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil won me over every single time she was on-screen, and Nicole Kidman committed to her role of Gretchen Carlson to the point that I believed every action she made. The problem is that the material they were working with didn't care about making a masterful piece of cinema. This movie would've worked so much better as a documentary in my opinion. Yes, these performances will absolutely be remembered, but the information I got from this movie is what I will remember it for, rather than the film itself.\n\nThis film is being recognized the most for Margot Robbie and Charlie Theron's performances and the Make-Up and Hairstyling awards, which it absolutely should be, but I also feel another positive is the fact that it also has no shame. This film is presented in a way that makes news outlets look like a disaster to work for and I admired that aspect. I enjoyed watching this movie for the most part, but it just felt like it dragged on, which was surprising, seeing as it only clocks in at about 108 minutes.\n\nIn the end, Bombshell is well-intentioned but ultimately comes across as an expos\u00e9. The performances are all fantastic and the story itself was intriguing enough to hold my attention the whole time, but there wasn't much else to latch onto. While this story deserved some kind of film, I don't believe an adapted narrative was the right decision. Overall, I would say this movie is worth watching, in terms of being informed, but it feels bland otherwise. I wouldn't say this movie deserves your attention, but the story does, however you choose to find out about it. As a whole, it's okay.", "reviewTitle": "Great Information in a Mediocre Film", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-04", "titleId": "/title/tt6394270/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "earthgirl-54214", "userId": "/user/ur68650209/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.43369178649240464, "id": "/title/tt6394270/userreviews/rw5333491", "interestingVotes": {"down": 145, "up": 140}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This film is quite good, but I think you HAVE to like politics and know Fox News to enjoy it.

Bombshell had the potential to be a great movie, but sadly for me was a massive let down and conveyed the complete opposite message to the audience that it was supposed to do. There were some good moments but lets talk about why this movie was such a disappointment for me.\n\nFirst of I must commend the pretty good performances from Charlize, Nicole and Margot. Everyone despite not being given the best material to work with, did a good job with that they had, with Charlize transforming into Megyn Kelly and Margot displaying a very emotional performance further solidifying her acting ability and versatility, and Nicole also portraying these qualities as well.\n\nHowever, my first negative linked to the previous paragraph would be that all three lead actresses were unlikeable. Margot Robbie's character played the stereotypical dumb blonde with no noticeable personality or likeable qualities about her, both Nicole and Charlize's characters were very one dimensional and bland, and just unapproachable making them characters that you didn't support throughout. They were also always contradicting what they were saying making them incredibly irritating. My next positives would be that there was a good uncomfortable tone set and there was some decent character development. Nicole's character had a decent amount of development within her job of trying to make a difference to her programme by promoting gun safety and women not having to wear makeup, only to be told its not the right thing to be telling women, which only motivated her more to do the show with more of these messages. So this was an interesting little development with her character. And also Charlize's character had the most interesting development within the film, as she stood for what she believed in and wanted to help women everywhere by trying to take down the boss and go against the extreme sexism that Donald Trump was displaying in his presidential campaign, but it was nice to see the development and conflict of her character when her and her family was receiving death threats giving her the debate about whether to protect her family or fight for what she believes in. Bombshell also managed to achieve a very good uncomfortable tone with the boss of fox news Roger Ailes, he consistently asked women to pull up their dresses to show off there legs in order to get jobs in his company leading to you feeling very uncomfortable and his character getting under your skin, but this was the desired passive response that the director wanted so this was executed very well.\n\nMy next negatives would be that the film didn't want any of the characters to be perceived as feminists, and the films direct narrative and dialogue to the audience was not needed. Throughout the whole film when all the female characters were asked if they were feminists or had a feminist agenda with what they were doing, they all said no. This was a stupid decision, as it was clear throughout the film that the whole reason for the women speaking up was because of feminism and equal rights. So for the film to contradict this was a big turn off for me and a odd decision, as this makes it more difficult for the director to portray the desired message of the film which was not executed well anyway which we will further discuss later. And also, the film had random direct dialogue to the audience with Charlize Theron directly talking to the audience. I did not like this whatsoever, it added nothing to the film, it made the pacing and narrative really clunky and really took you out of the movie.\n\nNext the film was fairly funny in places, I will always praise Kate McKinnon's humour in whatever film she is in. As I connect with her funny wit and she always brings a breath of fresh air into whatever movie she is in. And her appearance in this film gave it the much-needed comedic tone it needed.\n\nMy final two positives would be the films good messages and tackling modern issues of women in the workforce very well. The films message about people with different opinions being toxic was a good message to spread, as everyone has different opinions, and everyone should respect each other's opinions which Bombshell expressed very well. And the political messages about women not wearing make-up was also a fresh message for women and needs to be used more. And the film tackled sexual harassment within the workforce very sensitively and respectfully which was great. Going into detail about different women's experiences that sadly still happen today.\n\nHowever, my final negative for bombshell would be that it completely lost its female empowerment message by displaying so many stereotypes for women. The film either portrayed women as weak or not being able to stand up for themselves, pitting women against each other instead of them all working together as a team. And the unlikeable lead characters made women appear bitter and petty.\n\nOverall bombshell had its moments and had the potential to be a great movie. But sadly, it became a big disappoint, with its odd decisions with its narrative and script, and giving the complete opposite message about women then perhaps it intended.", "reviewTitle": "Bombshell", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-01-21", "titleId": "/title/tt6394270/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "JackCerf", "userId": "/user/ur0417057/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4092760444672076, "id": "/title/tt6394270/userreviews/rw5423729", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 6}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Since this is a political movie, I'm going to comment on it from a political perspective. Carlson, Kelly and the fictitious Kayla were all fine with short skirts and glass top desks. They all wanted to work for an enterprise that advocated all day every day that a toad like Roger Ailes or his master Rupert Murdoch is the highest type of humanity, who had earned the right to do as he pleased with his inferiors. Their employer disapproved of the laws prohibiting sexual extortion on principle, and they knew it and went along for as long as they could. They were all good, loyal servants of the patriarchy until it asked for 110% loyalty. What happened to them then resembles what happened to all of those good, true-believing Communists who Stalin shot or sent to the Gulag in 1937-39 because they were loyal to the idea and the system but not quite loyal enough to him personally.\n\nOf all the real, as opposed to fictional characters in the movie,the only one I had any sympathy for is Nancy Erika Smith, a hard nosed plaintiff's lawyer who has spent her whole life fighting and beating people like Ailes. Without Smith or an equally skilled employment lawyer, Carlson would have been rolled over by the Fox News litigatin machine. But then, there's nothing glamourous about her, so she got very little room, or credit, in a story about right wing blondes who supposedly saw the light.\n\nAiles deserved what he got, and worse.

Fox News is a circus at times but I really wanted to see a portrayal of the incidents surrounding sexual harassment and Roger Ailes. I also thought the three leads involved are really great castings and wanted to see how two of them portrayed Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. The film touches on important matters that has recently come to the light in droves, however the film doesn't always reach its potential although I did enjoy the film for the most part.\n\n The film is based on the story of the accounts of women who worked at Fox News and the allegations that came out against Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes. A movement that is led by seasoned television host Gretchen Carlson, after her firing from the company. She is soon joined by other women including Megyn Kelly. The film has a really great cast including Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, Charlize Theron, and John Lithgow. Jay Roach returns after a brief hiatus in film making to bring this effort.\n\n I have to commend the make up department firstly. Theron really looks like Megyn Kelly in this film that at times I feel like its hard to not see Kelly. Same with Kidman as Carlson. The acting delivers on all fronts. Margot Robbie who plays a fictional employee who typifies the type of victim Ailes prayed on, was also very good. I was very interested in the subject matter for this film as its timely and should make for a riveting story. A shocking story based on a wicked truth coming to light; this should be a very worthy film. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite reach that potential.\n\nI feel like the film could go deeper into making a statement although I was fine with what we got. At times it felt like the film was more interested in showing the real life correspondents being portrayed briefly, rather than going in depth into characterization. Not a bad film but feel like it wanted to be more and I also wanted more from it.

Forget creating a cogent story.\n\nIf the approach was more along the lines of 'Network' or 'Broadcast News' ...or even 'His Girl Friday', the story would've held more credibility. Instead, this comes off as an hour and 43 minute version of the Media's reality. In other words - a fantasy. A fantasy that the writers pour in real people and work to make them look bad. What ends up happening is all look bad and there's no conclusion to the film.\n\nInstead of creating solid characters set in the story, the writers and directors present what they want to present to make their case - A flock of blonde \"bimbos' to put on screen to sell their \"story\". In other words, they were sexually harassing those they hired to take the parts in the film. The \"Bombshells\" are the actresses more than those they portrayed. The two main actresses are far more attractive than the people they play. The third more attractive than just all all women in major television news. Sheesh! The film makers should say a line in the film, \"I feel filthy.\" for presenting the same efforts as they wrote of Fox news in the film.\n\nThis could have been so much better if the writers had concocted a tale with fictional woman with greater depth of each character and presented more viable reasons for the bad guy they wanted us to believe.

On one hand you have interesting plots for episodes, crazy situations, and twists and turns, and I'm the other you have predictable plots and writing. The acting was great, they made a smart move by getting actors that have worked on projects previously, and Wyatt Olef is perfect for his role. I enjoyed Sofia's performance as well, she really sold me on her character and her ability to change from being an angry or rude character to a charming and like able one is extremely impressive. I also loved Sofia Bryant, she was great for her role. All the acting was amazing so props to the casting director. One of my main complaints is the inconsistency with the episodes, some of the, were great, some were okay, and some I didn't like very much. This wouldn't be a problem if there were more episodes, but considering there are only 7 it was not convenient. The series doesn't drag along and the music is amazing. It perfectly fits the mood! I do feel like the last episode was the best one, and it made me feel like the story had just begun. That's another big problem. I felt like the first 6 episodes were all leading up to the real show. One good thing to come from this is that it made me want more from the show. The potential really shines through I'm the last episode and we get to see what the writers and directors can really do and I would have liked to see that more extreme tone through the season. I was suspecting something was going to happen but the scene really did leave me in shock. It was amazing! I want more of that in the show. My only advice for the writing team is do your research! Look at what other Netflix shows are doing and do not do that. That is the only way you're getting noticed. Break the clich\u00e9's! You've already started with having the protagonist having a crush on a girl. We rarely see a (possible) LGBTQ+ lead so props to you guys! Make something different and don't be afraid to take risks.

I feel like they could've been cut down into 1 or 2 episodes and accomplish just as much. And for a show that's only 7(!) episodes long, you don't have time to waste repeating yourself. They'd just have Sydney have a bad day, have her powers blow up, and then repeat.\n\nAlso for the first 4(Out of 7 episodes remember) Syd is just an absolute rude to the people who try to be nice to her (except Dina). For example, in the bowling alley scene, she makes light (and/or fun) of Stan's abusive relationship with his dad (also doesn't help that Stan seems a more interesting character than her)\n\nNow, I believe the show gets tremendously better from episodes 4-6. Syd gets to be more than just angry sad girl and gets to interact with Dina, Stan and her family in better ways and the story trajectory is looking very interesting.\n\nBut they couldn't stick the landing. And up until a point, I was loving the final episode. The characters are gelling together perfectly and the story's climax is *chef's kiss* Brad's death is such an interesting way to take the story but the writer's had to go and ruin it with the most lazy and CLICHE cliffhanger!\n\nI would've been perfectly fine if the show had just ended right there with Brad's death. However the writer's had to end it with that cheesy ass line \"Let's begin'' (It reminded me of S7 Game of Thrones writing it was that bad) It ends the story abruptly and leaves me so unsatisfied.\n\nNow, overall I think this show is a solid 6/10 and I will definitely tune in to season 2 but goddamn I am so annoyed right now", "reviewTitle": "Stan Barber Deserves A Better Show", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-02-27", "titleId": "/title/tt9446688/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "dailynewsandinformations", "userId": "/user/ur90430615/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.43683473790469424, "id": "/title/tt9446688/userreviews/rw5511963", "interestingVotes": {"down": 13, "up": 20}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Easy going, tailored by many cliches yet very adorable, good cast, leading character Sophia Lillis has star qualities", "reviewTitle": "fresh", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-27", "titleId": "/title/tt9446688/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "DarkVulcan29", "userId": "/user/ur4593705/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.43435525109377143, "id": "/title/tt9446688/userreviews/rw5527036", "interestingVotes": {"down": 3, "up": 8}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Sophia Lilies really shines like she did in It(2017), she plays Sydney, an awkward girl, dealing with tragedy.

The characters are dealing with trauma and trying to make sense of it, which is a great start. However, as the show kept moving, I couldn't help but feel like the wheels were slowly coming off. It feels like the writers bit off more than they could chew (To clarify, I mean that they created more plot hooks than they could resolve).\n\nI found myself feeling incredibly frustrated at the characters (except for Bode who, for some reason, happens to be the smartest and most capable out of everyone in the show) while watching them continually make decisions to facilitate their own demise almost without a second thought. It's hard to empathize with characters who don't think anything through. I felt incredulous as the Locke kids (mostly Tyler and Kinsey) kept getting completely duped by Dodge. The only thing that keeps the whole story together is that, for some unexplained reason, Dodge can't take the keys from the kids unless they give them up (apparently, a wizard did it or something). The moment they realize that, all they should have to do is keep the keys on them. Roll credits (they do subvert this a bit with Sam showing up and taking the \"go anywhere\" key, but that's quickly resolved in order to give it back to Dodge). Here's an idea, why not use the astral projection key to explore the omega door! or the well! Why not use it to spy on or locate Dodge? Use the head key and throw a bunch of books about the keys and Key House in your head! (the first thing I would have done is bought a bunch of books and thrown them into my head to become smarter than Dodge.) Tyler learns the entire history of the town this way (also some useless facts about Britain), but his knowledge never becomes useful. The writers love to show off the what the keys do, but they never truly explore what's possible. They don't end up learning the nature of anything involving the keys. Nor do they seem curious about how they were made or where they come from, even though their lives are at stake.\n\nWhen characters make bad decisions, the point is that there are consequences the characters will have to deal with. Instead of these consequences forcing character development, none of it is ever resolved (What happened to Sam? or the astral projection key? Bode knows how it works and not once does he suspect Sam might be a ghost even though they find his body in front of the door.) Instead, we get bait to keep us waiting for season 2 (Eden secretly getting hit by the \"bullet\" felt so lazy and unearned when they showed it after it happened. The family catharsis at the end also felt incredibly unearned as the whole audience knows they probably failed. I knew from the moment they found \"Dodge\" unconscious that it couldn't be that easy.) It's clear the show creators are more concerned with making more money than sculpting a compelling narrative.\n\nI predict Season 2 will feature the same villain with the same goal doing the same things (you can only use dramatic irony so many times before it becomes tiresome). I'm already bored just thinking about it. Count me out.

BrBa has a flawless storyarc, which neatly connects the first episode of season 1 with the final episode of season 5. The ending of the series, which has often been the weak point of many other great shows, feels almost inevitable - as many great endings in literature also do.\n\nThere is so much to be praised about this show. What impressed me most was perhaps the attention to detail. This is also the show where no loose end was ever forgotten - and, if not tied up, it would usually come back to haunt Walter White or some other character. There is also a strong sense of fate or even karma in this show - at one point literally hitting the protagonist out of the blue sky (if you have seen the show, you understand the reference). Walter White's cancer in the end becomes a metaphor for his own malice, that is slowly metastasizing in his soul. In the end, the philosophical question is whether one becomes bad because of one's deeds (while continuously rationalizing them as necessary and inevitable) or whether one does bad things because it is already part of one's character. The title, \"Breaking Bad\", seems to point towards the latter, whereas the ending of the show rather points towards the former.\n\nThe show often uses metaphor and allusion - sometimes in a way that will only be noticed by the most attentive of observers. For example, the curious model of a car Walter drives has been known to be a \"underachiever\" with unrealized potential, much like his owner. Minor details like an unrepaired crack in a windshield or a rotting pizza on a roof are constant reminders of the sinister events that have seeped into the suburban lifestyle - and they are milestones of Walter's moral journey into darkness, until things are beyond repair. Keep in mind that this is the man who feels compelled to \"fix things\" like a random shaky table with a napkin, but who becomes so power-hungry that he eventually declares: \"I'm not in the money business. I'm not in the drug business. I'm in the empire business.\"\n\nThe psychology of Walter White would lend itself to filling pages, but the same could be said for many other characters. I will never look at harmless hobbies like rock-collecting in the same way again - and the color purple has also gained some unpleasant connotations. I have also learned that a Roomba cannot fix a broken home and childhood.\n\nPerhaps the last piece of praise: the whacky humor of the show. There were moments when I simply did not know whether I should laugh or cry (I will never be able to use an ATM without thinking of this show). BrBa also has it's very unique take on American consumer culture and middle class suburban lifestyle - there is a lot of brilliant social and political commentary in this show (which, by the way, has been further developed in \"Better Call Saul\").\n\nAltogther, this show is a nearly perfect package and incredibly well-crafted.

It's like the story of Walter White glides through an anthology of classic crime movies without any lines drawn between which and where they begin or end.\n\nWhether you are a fan of Pulp Fiction, Scarface, The Usual Suspects, Departed, Goodfellas, American Beauty, Heat, even the Terminator and a touch of the Shining, or an ironic list of other famous films of different genres, you will find similar bits, pieces, semblances, as well as homages to them from time to time throughout. But don't expect any one of those films as a whole because this is a totally unique piece of art in itself.\n\nThe most entertaining aspect of the show for me was the Business part about it- the way the money is handled and the businesses are created, conducted, and operating are startlingly and impressively realistic in every way into every last detail. The drama, family, relationships, morality, crime genre, dark humor, and character development are all excellent or magnificent, but the realistic way the show handles the business aspect of the show was so impressive and really blew me away. The amount of detail that went into the story construction reveals that the creators did their homework, research, hired experts, and have had their own life experience with entrepreneurship and the business world.\n\n It is also important to the story because it is the main catalyst in the protagonists' profound motivations, which makes so much sense. This also branches off into money laundering and lots of big business meetings and dealings. The hierarchy of who is the boss, who is the helper, employee, partner, investor, associate, competitor, and new hire is perfectly arranged and realistic.\n\nIn addition, the protagonist must deal with the growing pains of the business world. Like many entrepreneurs, he succeeds and fails, starts over at times, restructures, learns the ropes, exploits advantages with his product in certain markets, and tries to reach a potential, or at least his goal.\n\nThe business aspect is more of an impersonal construct of the show, but it is the character development of not just the protagonist, but several main characters, that are incredibly conceived that is the best person part about the show. When you first meet many of the characters, they seem insignificant, or like they are going to be conventional side characters that only appear on the peripherals from time to time, but you can be surprised who these people really are or how significant they might be.\n\nThere are huge surprises, twists, turns, and mindblowing moments along the way, but don't expect them constantly. The show really takes its time in developing the characters, plot, and story- fleshing out its own world in the sunny Albuquerque suburbs and desert area- before it seldom pulls the trigger.\n\nThe first season and a half delve heavily into the protagonist's battle with cancer and the affect it has on him and his family, but they also introduce plenty of drama, suspense, action, and surprises. Dark humor is one of the predominant features of this part of the show. If you don't enjoy dark humor, you may find it slow at times, but if you stick with it, you will definitely be rewarded in the later seasons. If you do enjoy the humor, then this will probably become your favorite show.\n\nFrom late season 2 to the end of season 3, the show begins to turn slightly darker and become far more dramatic. There is family drama, drug drama, and crime drama. Season 4 is stunning and will blow the viewer away with brilliant writing, plot development, plenty of surprises, and nonstop suspense. It is loaded with classic scenes and episodes.\n\nSeason 5 is my personal favorite, as there is unbelievably no fat at all in any episode, for the most part, and this is the final season where all loose ends and everything revealed in seasons 1-4 all come back into play and receive closure, which elevates the entire meaning of everything that came before it.\n\nBreaking Bad is wickedly popular among fans, critics, and many top professionals in Hollywood, or the film industry in general. It has influenced, inspired, impacted so many writers, directors, actors, producers, and cinematographers. There are several popular shows and movies that have come out since it aired where you can pick up on direct borrowing and sort of imitating many things that Breaking Bad did on all different levels from story/plot, writing, character development, editing, and overall concept. Some people who have seen shows or films Breaking Bad influenced prior to watching it may not be as affected by some of its brilliance since they are working backward on the timeline.\n\nThe acting in it is truly amazing. It probably is the best acted TV series of all time without a doubt. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best acting performances ever, but the supporting cast is almost just as good. Usually, there is a dropoff in tv shows in movies; you'll have one or two great performances, but the rest of the smaller supporting cast is basic and average, but in Breaking Bad, there are truly excellent performances and the roster runs deep. This is the kind of show or movie where even the smallest roles are memorable. There really isn't one bad actor in any part of the series, and that's part of what makes it so good.\n\nLast, I'll mention the dialogue, quotes, and lines. I was not expecting this at all, but this show is loaded with famous lines and dialogue. It all ties back into the script writing, which is brilliant. So many scenes will blow you away with the witty, realistic dialogue and quotes. This is the hallmark of a classic work of film art. It just exceeds expectations for a TV series.\n\nOnce you are finished watching this masterpiece, watch it again because there is so much attention to detail that you can't pick up on in your first watch. There are all kinds of foreshadowing, symbolism, references, and little details that will make you appreciate it even more. This is not a show where one watch is enough. It gets better every time you watch it. Also, be sure to learn about the making of it, behind the scenes, the story of how it got made, all the Emmy awards and other awards it won, the records it set, what other prestigious names in Hollywood like Anthony Hopkins said about it, and all of the greatly written articles on it. It will really help you cope with it ending. But a warning: it is so addictive and good that you will probably find it difficult to let go, and every other show in the future will pale in comparison.\n\nIf you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, do yourself a favor and experience this once in a lifetime classic.

I just wanted to see the first few episodes to waste time on the day and see how the show is. I watched the first three episodes of the first season and I was intrigued. I thought it was good, but not to the level I was being told it was. I eventually got to halfway through the second season and I stopped watching for about a week. I wanted to see this badass Mr White that everyone was talking about but I was dissatisfied with how far he was from that at the S2E5 mark. I grew impatient and decided to stop. This is completely my fault. Not the show's. I knew there had to be a story behind his transformation but I didn't have the commitment to see it.

There are several moments when a scene takes on a different color and this makes us familiar with a particular character, moment or situation, which makes the scene in question speak for itself and give us a context without telling us directly (such as the scenes in the desert to give an example). Each color used generates a familiarity with the viewer and makes the moments seen throughout a chapter important and easier to remember in future chapters and settings.\n\nThus, Breaking Bad is a serie that brilliantly relates events and situations throughout each chapter, with music (composed by Dave Porter) and the different songs that are used throughout the series, raise to a higher level events that are already exciting to see.\n\nBreaking Bad is a serie that must be seen by everyone, without doubt, a piece that marks a before and after.", "reviewTitle": "One of the best television series in history.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-10-29", "titleId": "/title/tt0903747/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "ali_hamoud", "userId": "/user/ur66629909/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7411678130341214, "id": "/title/tt0903747/userreviews/rw4897341", "interestingVotes": {"up": 11}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I don't think that there will be series in the level of breaking bad...It is mysterious, has incredible actors and epic story. it is recommended for everybody", "reviewTitle": "Best series ever!!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-05-29", "titleId": "/title/tt0903747/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "johnandpheebs", "userId": "/user/ur7141244/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7402159232213279, "id": "/title/tt0903747/userreviews/rw4891659", "interestingVotes": {"down": 20, "up": 92}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad.

What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a melancholy, slow burning, comedic love letter to an age of Hollywood that we find ourselves disconnect from nowadays.\n\nThe point of this movie isn't to be just like Pulp Fiction and tell stories that have no meaning. In fact, I would argue that Tarantino wants each and every story to have a meaning. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a faded action star struggling to hold onto his career and fame. Every scene he was in was enjoyable, as he internally argues with himself to be better than he is. He can't find work except for as a typecast villain, and turns down an offer to go overseas initially because he thinks it's too far a step down from his past career. Dalton's story was not as fun to me as his stunt double, Cliff Booth's (Brad Pitt), but I will get to that in a minute. Dalton's story, some will say, was boring, overdrawn, and pointless. I say it was the most important and interesting storyline in the movie. Rick is an alcoholic, and deals with a lot of anger towards himself, particularly in his trailer (you'll see what I mean), and the long scenes showing him act out his part as the villain in the western are extremely entertaining as DiCaprio does some brilliant work letting us see Dalton as an actor without losing touch with him by slipping into acting of his own. He finally decides to go overseas, but most of that time is spent in a montage. When he returns, he dons a new Italian wife and an entirely new fashion straight from Europe. He doesn't do much towards the end, except for burn a manson follower alive in his pool, and then he finally becomes friends with his neighbors. I'll also get to that when I talk about Sharon Tate. Rick is representative of Hollywood at the time of 1969, and unless you are familiar with film history, that will be lost on you. In 1969 movies like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate were changing the face of Cinema by eroding censorship codes and finally getting the studios to hand the reigns to directors, thus entering the age of auterism. Actors like Rick were becoming absolete in film for a number of reasons, but mainly that they hadn't had to search for work whilst under the studio system, they just signed a contract and found work immediately. Roman Polanski, his neighbor, was one of the directors that was now given a lot of free reign in this age, . Dalton's character expressed the frustration many probably felt at the time, and Tarantino built a character that was beautifully acted by DiCaprio.\n\nCliff Booth on the other hand, was the most Tarantino character in the movie. I think he'll be the fan favorite, because he requires no historical context or empathy to understand. He's a stunt double who lives much worse than his star, Dalton, and is a no-no sense badass with a muddled past. His scenes were incredibly fun, as Pitt brought a certain energy to each scene that glued you to the screen waiting for his next move. Particularly at the end, when Tex had him at gunpoint and he was tripping on acid. Obviously he had the situation under control, but we as the audience have no idea until he sicks the dog on them. Booth was a character you expect to see in a Tarantino movie. None of his storyline was used for what people will say is \"pointless\", mainly because he is the most involved with the Manson clan.\n\nInterestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. Charles himself only shows up twice, and only says a few words. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point, and that is of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Her role, while a tad less utilized than I expected, was Central because the real life Tate was murdered by the Manson clan. If you go in as an audience member with that knowledge, you go the whole movie waiting for something to happen to her, and it never does. Tate herself was a happy, blooming actress who spent time with friends and danced (a lot). This carefree manner was underlying a want to be famous, as she tells people who she is and is clearly disappointed when they don't recognize her. Tate plays a role in this story of showing the era of actors now replacing Rick Dalton, and also showing special to Hollywood, the silver screen's allure. As this is essentially a long love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino pens what drew him to the screen through Tate.\n\nWith all of its references, obscure or in your face, there is a delicious amount to absorb, especially for cinefiles. Tarantino has the viewer to sit back, eat up the screen, and imagine we are right there with the characters in a wonderfully painted portrait of a Hollywood long gone. This movie will be misunderstood because of the expectations for the Manson murders, and because audiences nowadays expect action on every corner, which Tarantino's name can be attached to in some capacity. Without any crazy special effects to speak, simply a fantastic script and acting, I think many audience members will get bored or not understand why it's entertaining to others. I personally think it's one of Tarantino's best, if not his absolute best, and will stand the test of time for movie lovers everywhere.

So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.\n\nThere were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?\n\nThis was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn't made a good one in so long", "reviewTitle": "Was I even watching the same film?", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-09-01", "titleId": "/title/tt7131622/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Jimmy_the_Gent4", "userId": "/user/ur5537539/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6244328698237575, "id": "/title/tt7131622/userreviews/rw5024899", "interestingVotes": {"down": 990, "up": 1779}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders.\n\nLeonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of \"Bounty Law\" a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's \"Wanted Dead Or Alive\" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series \"Lancer\" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against \"The Mod Squad\" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the \"Lancer\" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.\n\nMargot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch \"The Wrecking Crew\" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.\n\nThe film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch.\n\nThe final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick's house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles \"Tex\" Watson, Patricia \"Katie\" Krenwinkel, Susan \"Sadie\" Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself. Then Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show \"Bounty Law\". Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick's house rather than Sharon's. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking \"Are they really doing this?\" Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\" and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened.\n\nI finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time.

Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer.

Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn't really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it's a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren't enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren't many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema.

Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.\n\nIn keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.\n\nThe film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled \"Bounty Law\". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.\n\nThere are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.\n\nThis is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent \"Fosse/Verdon\" or \"The Leftovers\", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (\"Lancer\"). 90 year old Clu Gulager (\"The Virginian\", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (\"Lancer\"). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.\n\n1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.\n\nIt's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to \"catch\" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.", "reviewTitle": "QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-07-25", "titleId": "/title/tt7131622/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Skin_Dude", "userId": "/user/ur34980076/"}, "authorRating": 4, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5606431412713011, "id": "/title/tt7131622/userreviews/rw5063601", "interestingVotes": {"down": 170, "up": 263}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Unbelievably boring and mundane movie apart from last 10 minutes.

They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.\n\nEntertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.\n\nIn addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.\n\nThe further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.\n\nSo the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.\n\nBy the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.\n\nAnd apparently there's a Season 3 in the works.

This show is a great example of when the netflix hype-train runs off the tracks and I will tell you why.\n\n The two main female characters are supposed to be tough and assertive but both become stereotypical \"I have feelings too\" characters you so often see in generic tv/movies. In the case of the police officer, we are talking about a career defining case that will take at most a couple weeks. We're talking about a 24/7 hostage situation which she is solely responsible for. Meanwhile you have a very young child at home who has said she doesn't want to live with you anymore. This is infuriatingly unrealistic. Let's just say for the sake of argument that the character is 42, and that she won't be having any more kids. She is a single parent, her mom who lives with her has Alzheimer's and both her mom and daughter's safety are basically in jeopardy by leaving them unsupervised. Now add in the 24/7 hostage crisis, working (for argument sake) around 18 hours a day. Instead of going home and checking on both of the only loved ones in her life, she frequently goes to get coffee instead of going home. So far, ok, people do shit like this, I can understand. The thing that really crossed the line is that she not only neglects her home life, but willingly divulges unnecessary information to a complete stranger. Again, we are talking about maybe a few weeks of what is really going to either define your career, or ruin it. The few weeks that will decide if your daughter will ever see you again. This entire course of events just seemed forced and unrealistic. She practised no discretion whatsoever (how did she get to the position that she is in in such a field?), her judgment is along the lines of a drunk college girl - spending more time thinking about getting laid then being an adult.\n\nThe other main female character (the robber), portrays this stone cold vicious attitude, and while other characters also exhibit that, she seems to be ruthless. Guess again. The one person she loved was killed in front of her but that didn't seem to phase her. Her mother even turns her in, still nothing. So she gets involved in this seemingly too good to be true heist and all you have to do is be professional, and don't form inappropriate and personal relationships with your co-workers (which applies to literally any job). Again, ok we are all human she lost a loved one, had her mom flip on her etc. I could understand something like this if she fell in love, but nope. She certainly doesn't love the guy, and I can't imagine how she ever would. He is naive, and practices poor judgment, doesn't have the heart to do what needs to be done, is basically a liability. It just doesn't fit her character to A. act so unprofessionally, and B. risk everything for someone she isn't serious about. Same rules apply to the robber as the cop, we are talking a 24/7 heist, a couple weeks at most, a life-time of either glory, or ruin. And yet again we get the \"I have feelings too\" story-arch superseding an unfathomable amount of money. It just doesn't fit the character to jeopardize that, be a professional thief/robber, and exhibit this kind of behavior during such a critical small amount of time.\n\nAs you can see this is beginning to become a pattern, and we see it again with the professor to a lesser extent. Basically (aside from the tough exterior) he jeopardizes years of work to get laid. I won't go into detail on the professor, but he really isn't that smart, but neither are the police, so I guess that's okay. I am not sure how the police do things in Spain, but the level of fuck-ups just seems uncharacteristic. We're talking about rogue officers jeopardizing dozes of lives, lack of discretion, poor police-tactics specifically during the raid(s), poor judgment (how the fuck can you not sweep for bugs when the government is sitting in and you obviously have a mole), and on top of that just overall incompetence from everything to PR to gross mishandling of evidence handling. The other detective drinking and driving to such an extent because he is emotional. It is all just so unbelievable, again though I am not Spanish so maybe that is the level of competence that their police show.\n\n\n\n As you can see, this is just the characters alone I have I outlined, and why I feel this show doesn't deserve to be rated as high as shows like Westworld, Mad Men, House of Cards, etc. It is actually rated higher than a few of those and just absolutely does not even belong in the same league.\n\nThe list goes on and I could make the case for other elements, other characters, etc. However, I will say that there are a lot of great things about this show. The plot is great, the 'idea' behind certain aspects of things like characters, methodology, behaviors, even things small things like the masks and fake gun rotation are excellent. The positives do outweigh the negatives, but not to the degree that warrants a near-perfect score.\n\nThe point of this review was not to bash the show, but to provide a more unbiased opinion (imo) because I experienced it in it's infancy with no real information available (I actually had trouble finding it on imdb). Also, because I feel that someone needs to speak up as the show has obviously been put on a pedestal because Netflix put their name on it.\n\nI do recommend this show because on the surface it is something different, and has a lot of unique qualities. It is entertaining, but nowhere near perfect.\n\n7/10 at most.", "reviewTitle": "Saw this before I could find any reviews any on here. It was called \"La Casa de Papel (The House of Paper)\".

There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns.

Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities. He embarrasses himself on more than one occasion but this causes people to underestimate him and his wit which he uses to actually solve crimes. This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. \n\nOverall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa...

Samberg is great at delivering the most ridiculous and silly lines of dialogue without mugging for the camera in the way that some might expect a former \"Saturday Night Live\" performer to do. Half of what Peralta says is either completely juvenile or inappropriate, but because it never reaches cartoonish or mean-spirited heights, he remains likable and easy-to-root-for. The show may eventually reach a point where it may seem absurd that the character is able to keep his job, though that hasn't occurred yet.\n\nIf \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" had just been a vehicle for Samberg, the show might have become stale after a few episodes. Wisely, the decision was made to make an ensemble series. It's typical for an ensemble to have one or two characters that aren't quite as funny or interesting as the others, but amazingly, every single character on \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" is excellently performed. Andre Braugher, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, and Terry Crews are all perfectly cast in their respective roles and each have moments where they shine in every single episode. Crews is absolutely hilarious as squad leader Terry Jeffords, especially when the writers are able to make great use out of both his physical strength and priceless facial reactions. In addition to the main ensemble cast, the reoccurring duo of Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller as Detectives Hitchcock and Scully, the two worst detectives in the department, are responsible for some of the best jokes of the series thus far. It's also worth noting the writers have made nice use of its guest stars including Craig Robinson, Andy Richter, Stacy Keach, and Dean Winters. Guest stars on sitcoms can be tricky and can often overshadow the episodes as a whole, but \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" almost always makes its guest stars fit organically into the plot in ways that never feel gimmicky or forced.\n\nAlthough there have only been a dozen episodes so far and there is always the chance that the broadness the show-runners have been so good at keeping down may eventually kick in, the series now remains as strong and frequently hilarious as any comedy on television at the moment. There isn't a particular formula that the show gets hung up on every week and more often than not, there seems to be an effort to get in a decent amount of character development by sitcom standards. If Fox is smart enough to keep \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" on for a while, it will almost certainly develop a cult following. If the ratings don't improve and only one season gets produced, at least the series will probably hold the distinction of not having a bad episode in the bunch. 9/10", "reviewTitle": "Best comedy on television", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2014-01-09", "titleId": "/title/tt2467372/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "thefreneticist", "userId": "/user/ur19957694/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6005867894746248, "id": "/title/tt2467372/userreviews/rw4860134", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 12}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Brooklyn 99 is a smartly-written, consistently entertaining, emotionally engaging ensemble sit-com you can marathon that will not made you sad.\n\nThink about that.

They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, \"I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out.\" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.\n\nThere certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.\n\nI don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.\n\nPeople who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.\n\nObviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.\n\nIn the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clich\u00e9s of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously.", "reviewTitle": "A surprisingly pleasant, silly yet witty show.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2013-09-19", "titleId": "/title/tt2467372/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "spasticfreakshow", "userId": "/user/ur25822740/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5888786839627869, "id": "/title/tt2467372/userreviews/rw2875166", "interestingVotes": {"down": 48, "up": 97}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Equal parts Mockumentary-style Comedy + Cop Show = A perfect parody of detective shows. The star detective (played by Samberg) winningly carries the lead with charm (if not grace), but as part of a true ensemble cast, carefully crafted iconic roles played well, and all won me over in the first episode. The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! \n\nThe producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed! There's a bit of a Naked Gun feel to it as well, what with the vaguely idiotic running gags and horseplay, but Jake Peralta is sharper (and more competitive) than Frank Drebin - leaving Charles to play the fool for him. When Peralta solves crime, it's not accidental - but neither can you take it very seriously, as even the arrest is more of an SNL skit than a semblance of a cop show arrest. I watched the pilot more out of curiosity (and Samberg fan-girl-ing) then out of any hope I would add this to my roster, but wonder of wonders, this thing actually works! Creative and original \"detective\" comedy - I'll be watching.\n\nI'd recommend this to BOTH people who can't stand cop/detective shows and just want to look down their nose whilst laughing at them, AND to people who love cop/detective shows, so they can learn just how stereotypical, clich\u00e9 and canned their favorites are.", "reviewTitle": "Cop Shows: Prepare to be Mocked!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2013-09-19", "titleId": "/title/tt2467372/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "MovieAddict2016", "userId": "/user/ur1173088/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5833740170675576, "id": "/title/tt2467372/userreviews/rw2893927", "interestingVotes": {"down": 32, "up": 68}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I'm confused by the reviewer (whose comment was featured on the IMDb page just now) who seemingly despised this program and wrote it off, apparently, because he or she felt Andre Braugher deserved better.\n\nI find this review odd, because \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" - if nothing else - comes across as a very likable show. \n\nThankfully spared of talking-head interview segments that have dominated the American comedy scene since The Office, this show also thankfully features no laugh track. Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a \"cop show\" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.\n\nThe cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the \"star\" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in \"Parks and Recreation,\" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws. Very few comedy shows are at their best in their first seasons.\n\nI'm enjoying this quite a lot so far - it's not must-see-TV or anything of the sort, but it's likable, entertaining and shows a lot of promise. The talented cast really elevates the material and the show manages to subvert cop show clich\u00e9s and workplace TV comedy tropes without seeming overly cynical or snide about it.

Despite this all of the characters are amazing as they are all likable and have incredible chemistry which makes this show one you should watch.\n\nIt mainly follows Jake Peralta who is a guy who loves his work, is incredibly immature and usually takes inspiration from action films like Die Hard whilst on a case. The show always follows the other characters in engaging and hilarious plot lines which also shows off different traits and experiences of their separate characters. \n\nWhilst it is an amazing show, it has it's flaws such as every finale has started to end in mostly the same way and the first couple of episodes of the next series will be centred around this one thing. As with any show there are some episodes that are not as good as the others, however after 4 seasons there are no seriously bad episodes so that is great.\n\nOne last issue is that there is a duo in the precinct called Hitchcock and Scully who exist solely to be gross out characters (Which I don't particularly mind) and are essentially the exact same character, however they can be really funny and they do have characteristics even though they have the least amount of character development than anyone else in the show. \n\nSo in conclusion this is an exceptional show which has a wide range of lovable characters and many different kinds of humour and jokes which are usually very funny. If you have seen a trailer for this show and it expect it to be another of those sitcom comedies like, New girl and The Big Bang Theory, it actually has a much higher level of quality then those two.

It's a movie that had true potential, but it is not up to the standard of a Pixar movie. No magic, great animation, and horrendous story production. The movie seemed rushed, timeline did not make sense, no positivity in the family dynamic, and the brotherly-love was only too short-sighted. Here are the issues that I have seen:\n\n\n* The boyfriend/step-father dynamic. Rather than having a positive representation of boyfriend/step-father dynamic, Pixar chooses to go the same negative route as everyone else. To have a dynamic where the boyfriend/step father views their step children negatively. But not only does Barley get mad at Ian for essentially telling him he's worthless - but Pixar refuses to mediate the hostility between the boys and the boyfriend. They also choose to let Barley and Ian say terrible things about the boyfriend. You know what would have also made a good story line? Is to talk about the journey of moving on and acceptance. These boys need to grow up see that they can still remember their father and accept someone new. Someone dropped the ball on this, and I am extremely disappointed.\n\n\n-The Manticore scenario. So, you're telling me that her place burned up in a fire and feels no ill as to what happened. Also, she's not angry anymore, considering it would be 30 minutes or less on the Onward timeline. No transition to the curse, terrible writing.\n\n-The timeline. So you travel for up to 18+ hours, yet it takes you 4 hours to get back where you started (with magic help, of course) and filled with 10 minutes of screen time. Also, the \"adventure\" part was ridiculous, too many things they had to do to get back to the High School. The whole trip didn't make sense.\n\nHow did this story even get green-lit? Maybe because the team felt they had to prove themselves during the transition of the new Director, Dan Scanlon from the executive producer, John Lasseter. I truly hope that the magic did not disappear when Lasseter left, but at this rate, Pixar's new upcoming movie, Soul, also looks just as disappointing as Onward. Nevertheless, I feel Pixar is going on a downward spiral, being subpar in every way possible. Specifically with Dan Scanlon leading the way, as he's been behind Incredibles 2 and Monsters University (which, in my opinion, were also sub-par films) and only one great film, which was Inside Out.\n\nI truly hope that Pixar can find other great directors to lead the way, and find innovative story lines to tell.

He's a bit of a sap with no real get up and go about him. Chris Pratt voices his Barley, his older brother who spends most of his time playing Dungeons and Dragons type fantasy games which he believes are all based on the reality of a time before the world settled into using technology rather than the ancient magic of the land.\n\nOn his 16th birthday, Ian is presented with a gift his dead dad (it's not a Disney film without a dead parent) left for him. It's his old wizard's staff, and Ian and Barley are given a spell to bring him back to life for just one day. Barley has vague memories of his Dad but Ian, having never met him is keen to see him. They attempt the spell but it goes wrong and only the legs come back, leaving the boys with a dilemma. Do they just have their dad's legs for 24 hours or go on a quest to find a new crystal which will help them complete the spell and see their dad.... Spoiler alert... They go on the quest.\n\nAnd from there, the whole film kinda fizzles out.\n\nPixar have always found the perfect balance between kids and adults for me, but whilst watching this I couldn't help but think that nothing in there was pitched at me as an adult, yet too much was aimed over the heads of kids... So just what is the audience for this film?\n\nIt's not particularly funny, and underwhelmed me so much after seeing a trailer which really made me think this was going to be an emotional roller-coaster of a film, but in the end it lacked heart and definitely lacked laughs.\n\nSide characters fail to add much to the story. Octavia Spencer's \"The Manticore\" is a slight uplift in the story as a beast who has now mellowed and is running a themed family restaurant instead of getting involved in Quests.\n\nBut that's it.\n\nI think kids will enjoy the fantasy behind it all, but it's just a long way from being a great film for me.", "reviewTitle": "Underwhelming after a promising trailer", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-11", "titleId": "/title/tt7146812/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "vgamerdc", "userId": "/user/ur25898836/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.32815996369055006, "id": "/title/tt7146812/userreviews/rw5534852", "interestingVotes": {"down": 48, "up": 36}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Hey Pixar, I'm gonna be honest. I didn't like your film. The first 30 minute you go by-the-book with lazy Save the Cat screenwriting work time make your audience pity the protagonist as much as possible. There is awful on the nose dialogue and exposition. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are only using their voices to act, there's no real emotion, but that's not your fault on the writers team. Things in act 1 I didn't like was the list making, the film schooly silent storytelling, and the manipulation between the character and audience in a poor attempt to create sympathy.\n\nOnce our adventure began and our characters started being active and doing things, working with each other, I did begin to enjoy it. The shrinking visual gag was good, and I enjoyed the characters we BRIEFLY met and locations along the way. However, I still felt you pulling my strings.\n\nHowever, after we escaped the water area I did feel you tightly puppeteering again. The end of act 2 low point break up was super forced; Tom and Chris's dialogue was was too on the nose and their acting was not good. \"Good acting is loving truthfully in imaginary circumstances\" - Sanford Meisner. The acting in this film was all forced through the voice. Same with the animated acting.\n\nI'm sorry guys, I wanted to like your film but I didn't. The story is very basic, something a high school screenwriter attempts, your characters aren't very deep, your emotional connection isn't character based-The father/son connection is pulling too much fro reality like Murph and Cooper in Interstellar. There weren't many good jokes in the foreground or background (come on, I know you guys watch BoJack Horseman). And surprisingly, perhaps because this seemed so corporate driven, it felt RUSHED. I imagine if you either cut scenes and extended others to be more character based, rather than rushing as fast as you can to finish the film (or frankly just shorten Act 1 by a lot), you could have the same run time and even more Story!\n\nIf you read to the end of this review I thank you for giving my vocie an opportunity to be heard and I hope Pixar takes their time making ART instead of basic commercial films which follow a predicated template and are only notable because of the company name.", "reviewTitle": "Survive the first 30 minutes and prepare to be manipulated", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-03-08", "titleId": "/title/tt7146812/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "azaugg-97470", "userId": "/user/ur108366528/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.32811517052694444, "id": "/title/tt7146812/userreviews/rw5508868", "interestingVotes": {"down": 63, "up": 45}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "A funny, beautiful film.

He didn't really portray much emotions which is a bad thing if you play a character who has such a serious storyline. Some scenes, especially in the first few episodes, felt awkward. I can't exactly point out why that was. I blame it on the acting and maybe also the camera work.  I also haven't made up my mind about wether or not I like the characters. Sometimes they are real assholes and/or don't feel like realistic, complex human beings. Other times I really liked them.  I'd say that the girl,Monse, is my favourite and gives the most consistent (good) performance. There were some sexist tropes that bothered me but I won't go into it here. It would have been cool if the creators had realized this and deconstrucetd it in the same way the deconstructed other elements / tropes but you can't have everything and it's probably only a minor detail for most viewers. \n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed the show and might even watch it a second time. It made me laugh out loud on several occasions even if the humour wasn't always my taste.  It's not a master piece, it doesn't stand out but it's also better (I feel) than your average TV show and offers an original take on an old concept.", "reviewTitle": "It has its flaws, but I still enjoyed it", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2018-03-17", "titleId": "/title/tt7879820/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "jasmina-reyes", "userId": "/user/ur33806669/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4676952187025448, "id": "/title/tt7879820/userreviews/rw4106089", "interestingVotes": {"down": 3, "up": 9}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Just finished watching the entire season and I'm shook!!!

Sometimes even a very minimalist story can reach an incredibly successful point after the right production stages. The Witcher series is far from minimalist. The Witcher is one of the best Middle-earth works in the world. Production quality is essential if you want to handle such a topic successfully.\n\nThe world that The Witcher goes through is a world with its own rules, races, characters, creatures, beliefs, even if it does not seem too strange to those familiar with fantastic narratives. In particular, the first two chapters carry the risk of being too confusing while reflecting the details of this world to the audience. After the chapters where it is difficult to fully understand which character serves whom and why, the story becomes more beautiful as the other characters gradually increase in the narrative. There are two main characters in the narrative except Geralt. One of them is Ciri, who was advised to find Geralt when her lands were taken over by the enemies. The other is Yennefer, a kind of witch whose aim is to gain as much power as possible. While the goal of these two characters is evident, the fact that Geralt at the center of the narrative does not have a significant motivation due to the character's characteristics causes the story to be thrown from one place to another. However, the story deepens as the characteristics of this character become evident and the dynamics of the world in which events take place gradually emerge. It is the primary factor that gives the dark tone of The Witcher's world that people use their power and material resources to seize land. The dark narrative that expresses the evil within man is supported by the visual language of the series. The visual language, dominated by darkness and shadows, brings The Witcher closer to a gothic horror narrative from time to time when combined with the characteristics of the characters it contains. This dark atmosphere also gains a realistic tone with the violence of the series. The Witcher, one of Netflix's most courageous works to date, relentlessly conveys the mess of the world it tells. It creates a consistent and dark atmosphere thanks to well-captured battle and combat scenes and technical details such as image management and music usage. 9/10", "reviewTitle": "The Witcher: Blood, Dark, Magic, etc.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-20", "titleId": "/title/tt5180504/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "shreet-shreet", "userId": "/user/ur27537927/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.66514282755419, "id": "/title/tt5180504/userreviews/rw5372254", "interestingVotes": {"down": 364, "up": 818}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I have played Witcher 3 and read some of the books, I'd say I love W3, they did an excellent job with the characters, the world and the overall writing, and the books are brilliant as well. Now coming to the show, starting with what I liked - Cavill's Geralt is absolutely spot on, he nails it. The production value is also decent and some of the side characters like Tissaia and Jaskier are done well. Fight scenes are top notch, Cavill brings the physicality to them that was required.\n\nNow to the bad. Everything is rushed, the pacing is terrible and it's full of awkward timeline jumps that are done so badly that it will confuse even the avid fans of the series. Dialogue at some instances are horrific and the majority of the jokes did not land. The storytelling suffers because of the terrible pacing and the timeline jumps. There is no room for character development, if you do not already know these characters, the show doesn't make any efforts to make you relate to them or care for them(except for Geralt). Infact some of the character and their arcs are changed for the worse in the show. For example, in the books and in W3, Yennefer is sometimes arrogant but she's also genuinely intelligent and cares for people she loves. In the show she does nothing smart, we are just forced to believe that she's intelligent and she throws everyone around her in a dustbin. Yennefer's character segments are all either her whining about what she didn't get from life or acting smart(instead of doing anything smart). She's a complete fool in the show. Other characters like Calanthe, Vilgefortz and Eyck of Denesle are also portrayed horribly.\n\nThe casting is bad as well. Except for a few actors, none of them seemed like they belong in a Slavic/East European medieval fantasy setting. Beauty is subjective but some people look better than other in general, Triss looks nowhere near as good as she's supposed to, and infact the minor female character(Renfri) that we meet in the first episode looks better than almost the entirety of the rest of the major female cast whom we know are supposed to look beautiful.\n\nAnd talking about Slavic roots, well, there doesn't seem to be any here. There is no hint of the Slavic folklore and culture present in the show. W3 did the adaptation of the folklore so brilliantly with all the different East European(and Scandinavian) dresses and costumes, the various folk monster/beast designs, the stories and superstitions of the land, the little intricate details within the accents and the language, and the rituals and customs of the local people. These are the things that differentiated the witcher series from other medieval fantasy stories. There none of that here. But I'll tell you what's here that CDPR didn't put in their games and neither did Andrzej Sapkowski put in his books - The politics of 2019. There is forced diversity, there is the b***sack Nilfgaardian armor which is intentionally made to look like a d***, to show Nilfgaard as a generic evil patriarchal empire of d***heads, there are characters ruined by the feminist writers' take on them like Yennefer who acts like a snowflake instead how she's supposed to from the books. We have all this and more that no one asked for. It feels like a generic 2019 diversified medieval show with high fantasy elements. This ain't witcher.\n\nTo sum this up, it's not a straight up bad show, but a painfully mediocre one. Though if not for Cavill's brilliant portrayal of Geralt and the very obvious high production value of the show, maybe I would give this a 3. What they needed to do was to take it slow and do what they did in the first episode(which was the best of the season imo) i.e. start with Geralt's adventures and stories and build up the main narrative(a shorter, more focused one than what this show had) towards a longer season of 13 or 24 episodes. That gives us more time with the characters, and gives the writers more room for exposition and world building, which would have eventually resulted in a more coherent experience. For season 2, I'm hoping they would honor the Slavic foundations and the identity of the witcher series, improve writing and pacing, and deliver quality over quantity without a rush for completing the saga. They might need to change up the writing staff and rethink their decisions for this to happen; but looking at the fan reception of this season, I highly doubt that will happen.", "reviewTitle": "Terrible writing, bad pacing, confusing timeline, no character development, lack of identity, but with a decent protagonist", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-01", "titleId": "/title/tt5180504/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "mjburkett", "userId": "/user/ur0594574/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.645517572609629, "id": "/title/tt5180504/userreviews/rw5392993", "interestingVotes": {"down": 130, "up": 291}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "For someone who doesn't know the story, the screenplay and directing make it hard to follow.

What I ended up witnessing was some cheesy show that reminded me of a bad fantasy you'd see in the 90s.\n\nThe Witcher is based off a series of books, the first being The Last Wish. I've only read the first book but am by no means a purist. Changes can be made to the source material and still be good, as seen with LOTR. It's just that everything else has to be good and that's where the Witcher fails.\n\nThe overall production of the show is poor. The cheap quality gives off the vibe that you are watching a soap opera or stage play instead of being immersed in the world. This problem is amplified with how the shots are framed along with the dialogue delivery. Also some of the costumes are akin to something you'd find in a bargain Halloween store.\n\nThe script could definitely use some work. The dialogue at times is hilariously bad, often making a scene that should be exciting turn into something more like a parody. And even the non-dialogue actions ruin battles, like someone taking their helmet off during war to make a cringe scream while being immune to enemies for 30 seconds, or kissing mid battle to unleash a powerful spell.\n\nThe show is structured in an odd way with different timelines. For me it wasn't too hard to follow but I have seen many others wondering what the hell is going on. The problem with the timelines is that they throw the pacing off. I think the show would've been better if it focused mostly on Geralt and his adventures as those were by far the best parts of the show.\n\nThe Witcher isn't all bad. Henry Cavill is fantastic as Geralt and I also enjoyed the character Jaskier. There's some good battles with the swordplay being a high point.\n\nAnd it looks like the showrunners are listening to criticism and said that season 2 will have a tighter story. I hope the show can get a bigger budget to improve effects and that the writers can fix some of the bad dialogue. There's potential here, but unfortunately this first season falls short.", "reviewTitle": "Not that good", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-01", "titleId": "/title/tt5180504/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "conorarranmore", "userId": "/user/ur105093617/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6218194622003657, "id": "/title/tt5180504/userreviews/rw5472357", "interestingVotes": {"down": 39, "up": 93}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "A jumbled, incoherent and confusing mess of a show.

I have played all the games - love them, not all equally but they are good taken in historical context. I have seen most Fantasy shows worth watching and some not worth watching, my interest Started with Hercules and Xena and have been watching ever since.\n\nNow this show: The main problem is that it feels like a fan fiction without understanding the source material. I get it that they have to change to suit the TV format and redo the story a bit but the main thing that should not change is the fell of the story. There is too many WTF moments and bad acting. I am no stranger to bad acting and can usually ignore it for an entertaining story as I have done with the Hercules and Xena shows but this show is not entertaining either.\n\nThe bare bones of the Witcher universe is that the characters should act more or less like real people in a less then friendly world with many injustices and where the protagonists usually get screwed in some way, either by \"destiny\" or by other people that are being petty and cruel or sometimes they get unusually lucky but very rarely.\n\nWhat made Geralt an interesting protagonist is still there to some extent so that aspect is fine. Geralt is essentially a knight errant constrained by a personal moral code that contradicts with the Witcher code, which produces some less than ideal situations for him.\n\nHowever what made Yennefer interesting is now completely gone and what replaced her is an idiot instead of a mature and powerful sorceress, we get a petty child that is angry at the world she asked for.\n\nThen there is the casting of this show that is done purely for political correctness to fill some diversity quota and ruin immersion. I care little if they are not the right color but when they suck at acting too then I will call it what it is: a diversity hire.\n\nThe writing is probably the weakest part of the show with modern colloquialisms and bad story telling, it is an attempt at a less linear story telling that ultimately fails and just confuses people because there are no markers and events to give you a hint of what story tread you are following.\n\nThe directors and show runners simply suck in most aspects and were also probably hired to fill a diversity quota instead of merit. Something to the effect of we need a woman to direct this instead of someone that understands the Witcher universe and what makes it unique. Bad is bad I don't care who you are, your work sucks.\n\nThe cinematography is weak and the production values suck, you have a party in medieval times that looks like a pretentious modern party with bricks partially exposed and cheap lighting. The best that can be said about the CGI is that they are equal to the Hercules and Xena CGI.\n\nThis show is objectively bad and I think people are defending it out of pure fandom for the other material.", "reviewTitle": "Just bad fan fiction only improved by Henry Cavil", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-29", "titleId": "/title/tt5180504/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "sangmesh27", "userId": "/user/ur33760895/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6210213830679766, "id": "/title/tt5180504/userreviews/rw5342431", "interestingVotes": {"down": 454, "up": 834}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "The acting skills, direction, production quality of the show is top notch, henry cavill is superb, first being a avid fan of witcher books and games i was a bit skepticle on seeing the trailers etc, but oh my!!!!, The show is just plainly good.

The series consists of fun and masterfully choreographed sword fights, limited but impressive visual effects, eminent music, beautiful and immersive cinematography which presents the world of The Witcher in a more than satisfying way.\n\nAnother reason why The Witcher works are its unique stories; every episode progresses the main plot while having one or more just as interesting subplots leading up to gratifying season finale.

In a way that there is no way one can believe the events described in the series. Even if we suspend belief for the entertainment value, there are too much inconsistencies, twists and coincidences that start to bother right from the beginning. In order not to give spoilers I won't go into detail but there are some major moments which are too soap opera that I forgot I was watching a thriller/ crime mystery adapted from a novel by one of the most successful writers of this genre. Then I remembered that the only novel I've read from H. Coben was not to my taste either.\n\nAdaptation was also basic. Whenever something significant happens we are kindly reminded of the moment that is related to that revelation by flashbacks, why? I guess because we are too stupid to make the connection by ourselves.\n\nThe acting; I really enjoyed watching Anthony Head (Although I must admit his acting is always the same acting since Buffy, which is fine by me). Kaye was good, Dooley was good, so were all the actors/actresses in the second roles, the children especially. Husband was ok. I had a problem with Kirwan's adoring mother portrayal . It was just not convincing . And the lead dedective Jo (?) character did bother me . I think the ending was an insult to her , a quick fix in her personal and professional life. The actress was trying hard but there was no purpose or depth in her character.\n\nTo sum up, very superficial, meaningless, like an AI generated story ... that I could not stop watching because it had a junk food quality to it. Everyone likes to watch beautiful houses and cars and people with beautiful clothes on, with the exception of the bad guys of course. They were not fashionable :) I also kind of wondered what will happen in the end , not to the characters because they became so annoying that I did not care anymore , but I wanted to see how they will tie everything up. It was done quickly .\n\nSo a success despite all the flaws. A crowd pleaser. But if you are serious about crime fiction, watch Hinterland instead.

I have no idea whether the original book is any good but based on this interpretation I won't be finding out. The number of plot holes; irrelevant red herrings and dodgy technological slights of hand were just unbelievable.\n\nWhy did we have a whole plot line based around a barely credible teenage drugs party resulting in an unconscious naked guy in the woods and a decapitated Alpaca. Even these two items weren't really connected and neither had anything to do with the main storyline. How were the blackmailers able to get the information to blackmail their victims so easily and why would some of the victims even pay up? I wasn't buying it. I could go on at length about this but I don't have the energy. How convenient that the relevant people had a tracker on their phone which worked in real-time irrespective of signal coverage. Why were the police so dumb? They didn't seem to follow even basic procedure, e.g. no formal interviews. Why did one of their officers seemingly have access to a handgun in the UK (which is extremely unlikely) and be prepared to use it to commit murder on the weakest of premises i.e. to help fund his daughter's health treatment where all medical costs are covered by the state! Why did the husband not tell the police when he nearly caught the blackmailer but was prepared to tell them by text later when it conveniently fell into the wrong hands to help the storyline?

It's definitely not a show for everyone, and even I can admit that it dragged just slightly at times, but I thoroughly enjoyed all 8 episodes.\n\nFirst of all, the best part about The Stranger was Richard Armitage. I have loved him as an actor for over 10 years, ever since he starred in the underrated BBC version of Robin Hood as one of the villains, Guy of Gisbourne. He was also excellent in The Hobbit films, but I actually think his best role to date was playing Adam in The Stranger. The rest of the cast also did an excellent job in their supporting roles, but there are way too many actors to mention here.\n\nOne of the most important parts of a show like this is to keep the audience engaged in the story, and The Stranger did just that. There were lots of twists that I didn't see coming, and it made it an easy binge because I constantly wanted to click to the next episode to see what was going to happen next. We didn't get all of the answers straight away, and most of them were carried through right until the end of the show, but The Stranger was always intriguing and kept me locked in to watching the journey of these characters unfold.\n\nThe Stranger also asks the audience philosophical questions, which gave me something to ponder. I highly doubt we will get a second season because this was based on a standalone book by Harlan Coben, but it did a nice job of wrapping everything up and leaving me satisfied.\n\nOverall, The Stranger was a well-made, intense, gripping thriller, with fleshed out characters and storylines that I was invested in.

Now let me explain how this movie is completely ruined.\n\n1. Characters have no facial expressions - So in the original if you just turned off the sound you'd still be able to understand what's going on as the body language and facial expressions were a big part of what brought these characters to life. In the new film simba looks like a real lion and similar to a real lion he has zero facial emotion. This is true for all the characters.\n\n2. The voice acting is horrible - everyone talks incredibly unemotional and SLOW. These actors have likely been told in production to do so as otherwise it would have looked weird for these animals to move their mouths so fast. Even Mufasa's voice is far slower and less emotional while it's still the same voice actor. They really talk half the speed and have odd pauses in their dialogue. Emotion is gone entirely.\n\n3. Clever jokes and small exchanges are not in this movie - Because characters talk so slowly they can't say as much. Therefore all small jokes and clever exchanges are left out. A few are kept in, but fall flat as the timing is off now. For instance when in the original Simba and Nala go to the elephant graveyard the hyena have all these fun exchanges and they are left out in this movie, Instead we get 2 hyenas that are particularly unfunny...\n\n4. The songs are ruined - In the original movie, songs bend real physics and reality to give an expressive montage that was visually stunning. Here they just walk or jog a bit.Then a few other animals might appear, but that's about it. Songs are also played at a slower tempo which in itself ruined all the momentum out of the song.\n\n5. Simba is unlikable - Before simba flees away from pride rock you feel his character is a bit reckless and a bit cocky, but he is also brave and has the characteristics of a leader as he protects others. In the elephant graveyard he stands up for Zazu (while he does not even like zazu) saying the hyena's should pick on somebody their own size. When he and nala then have to run for their lives nala is falling behind. Simba then runs back and saves her by scratching Shenzi. These 2 things do not happen in the remake, which make simba a cocky guy only caring about the power he will get as a king. In the second half you'll start to wonder if he really should be king.\n\n6. Filler scenes - There are a few additonal scenes or things that are dragged out that give zero character development and do not bring new information at all. You'll notice these scenes in the film, but to give 1 example I'll tell the one that's the least spoilery. Remember that mouse that scar grabs under his hand in the beginning? You see him run up to the camera, wash his nose and BAMN. Scar has him under his paws. In the remake we see this mouse crawl for a whole minute. Why?!? Later in this movie there is something that took the original 5 seconds too, but here takes 2 minutes! They're are really struggling to make the movie 1 hour and 50 minutes, whereas I do not think it's necessary at all and they could have just made a movie of 1 hour and 25 minutes as the original was.\n\nThis movie has no soul and leaves a bad taste towards the original.Disney has lost all it's credibility and respect it still had left by making this atrocious movie.", "reviewTitle": "No soul.", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-07-21", "titleId": "/title/tt6105098/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "terry-46096", "userId": "/user/ur62833377/"}, "authorRating": 3, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7012512356962348, "id": "/title/tt6105098/userreviews/rw5006192", "interestingVotes": {"down": 393, "up": 1036}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "The movie is adequate, that's not good enough for this live action though.

I wanted to love this movie. I was over the moon excited for it. They took out too many important parts of the original. Showing the strength of Mufasa but also his friendly side (his friendship with Zazu, how he respects and hugs Rafiki, that he taught Simba how to pounce). Even the opening scene wasn't the same. Why would you alter that? The huge rising sun in tune with the music that gives almost everyone goosebumps. The new one you see trees with a slightly lit up morning sky and then a small sun appears off to the side that isn't in sync with the music. Mufasas personality doesn't sound the same even though it's still James Earl Jones' voice. It's different somehow. The hyenas are not the same. They don't make jokes and laugh at themselves like \"make mine a cub sandwich\" then laugh hysterically at their own jokes. They eliminated Ed, the one who doesn't speak, just laughs. Timon isn't flamboyant or half as funny as the original. The hula scene in the original was fast paced and funny to distract the hyenas. The new one he slowly sings \"Be our Guest\"?? No action and not as fun. In fact, ALL of the new characters (including Beyonc\u00e9) sound like they are just reading from a script and it's really mundane and forced. None of them are in character and flow like the original. There's no sass or wit. The music is boring. It's a huge disappointment. Rafiki catches Simbas hair and knows immediately it's him. In the original, he knows the scent, but it takes him a minute to figure it out and when he does, he's ecstatic. Not in the remake. There is no image of Mufasa in the clouds to guide Simba to remember who he is. Rafiki doesn't give him a lesson about how the past can hurt with his stick. Simba doesn't hug Rafiki like his father did which is also symbolic to how Simba is like his father.

The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you \"don't know that you're missing till it's gone\". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the \"less projecting voices\" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing \"broadway aspect\" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???\n\n2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?\n\nWithout the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only.

Seth Rogen (Pumba) was the only decent individual that matched his role and thats just because it's the easiest role to fill!\n\nSecondly, changing certain plot points didn't flow as smoothly, in other words, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" The hyenas were all of a sudden not comic relief or goofy, but instead more on political and serious. Timo and Pumba have a whole new group of friends in there jungle paradise, which isn't a big deal, but it makes it seem less like a special place that the three share.\n\nThirdly, most of the movie is a visual flex, they focus less on story and more on trying to show you what their capable of with live action. There are scenes that will unnecessarily take longer than it should, just to be visually appealing.\n\nFinally, this movie did something so wrong, unlike the other Lion King. Instead of showing us emotion, they would consistently try to express it with dialogue. SHOW MORE, SAY LESS.

Yet again.\n\nBecause I was right in not wanting to see this film. Because this is the bottom of the barrel. The other movies have kind of been shot for shot remakes, but every single one of them has had at least something new. Some other angle, some twist, to make it interesting. This, one the other hand? Holy cow in heaven, is this bad. The beginning, for example. You know, The Circle of Life, one of the most recognizable and striking movie openings in history. The exact same. Shot for shot, camera angle for camera angle, the exact same. Except, you know, not as colourful, iconic or fetching. Because it's supposed to look real. Which in this case apparently means that everything looks either more wrinkled, dusty and/or dirty in general. Because that's Serengeti for you. According to the film makers.\n\nLuckily they stopped with the exact shot for shot soon after that, thank heavens, but that was only a minor relief. Because you know what else happens, when you try to make everything look as real as possible? Aside from everything looking like it's going to give you fleas. It makes everything look emotionless! Lions are not exceptionally renowned for their wide range of facial expressions, you know. The reason you can make animated movies with animals as the main characters is because animation doesn't care that lions can't have facial expressions. You can go outside the realms of biology and what's strictly speaking possible. You can exaggerate, emote and play loose with the rules. You can use colours, shapes and perspectives to compensate, to make it look interesting. This film has none of that! It's a dull, emotionless, flat table reading of dialogues we all know and love, but which are given nothing to support them.\n\nNot helping the matter is the fact that they hired celebrity voice actors. These people are talented entertainers, yes, and they look fetching on a poster, but none of them is exactly renowned for their voice acting capabilities. And boy does that show! Even James Earl Jones sounds like he's about to keel over and pass beyond the veil at any moment.

My review might be influenced by how much I love Jane Austen's novel and how many times I've watched the 2009 miniseries, but I always give every adaptation a try. And I can't really judge if what I was watching would make sense to an Austen virgin, shall we say, so what seemed disjointed and rushed to me might work perfectly for others.\n\nI'll start with the good: I loved the costumes and the interiors, which were sumptuously beautiful. The wood-shaving ringlets on the women and the high collars on the men were distracting, though. And of course Anya Taylor-Joy made for a quirky and regal Emma (Austenites will be pleased to note that she has perfect posture.) I also loved how Anya Taylor-Joy and Amber Anderson as Jane actually played the pianoforte during the Coles' party (but could have done without Mr Knightley's contribution, when Frank Churchill is supposed to be singing with Jane). BUT. The music was horrendously jarring, alternating between Hanna Barbera cartoon incidentals and freakish folk music. The supporting characters suffered once again - I couldn't honestly tell the difference between Mrs Weston, Mrs Knightley and Mrs Elton, except that Isabella was for some reason a complete cow in this version, and Mr Elton and Frank Churchill were also interchangeable (perhaps that's why Elton never seemed to be without his dog collar, to help tell them apart). Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was a weird combination of fusspot and Edwardian fop, and Johnny Flynn's Mr Knightley strayed way off character by stripping off in his first scene and never really recovered for me. (Apparently, that was a way of 'humanising' the character because he is always 'mansplaining' - very woke.) Anya wasn't kidding when she talked about the focus being on 'bodily functions', by the way - not only are we 'treated' to Knightley's backside, but Emma hitches up her skirts to warm her bare arse by the fire, and the 'cannot make speeches' proposal scene is a bloody mess. Literally. The script leans so heavily on lines from the novel that I think Eleanor Catton thought she was writing an essay for an English Lit exam - Austenites will be happy, but there was no feeling behind any of the grand words. When Emma and Mr Knightley argue, they constantly shout over each other, for instance, instead of the usual playful back and forth.\n\nThe whole film felt like a weird mashup between a stage musical and a Victorian farce, with choreographed servants and slapstick humour. There was also a lot of 1996 Emma in there, taking pastel and pastoral scenery from the film and Andrew Davies' wearisome obsession with wealth from the television two-parter. Not on a sliding scale of Emma and Miss Bates, but in how Mr Knightley's strawberry picking party turns into a National Trust promotional video for Wilton House, Salisbury. There's also a lot of emphasis on servants dressing their masters and mistresses, presumably to fit in more scenes of 'natural nudity'.\n\nI went, I watched, I did my duty to Emma. But I think I'll stick with the 2009 miniseries.", "reviewTitle": "All bonnet and no breeches", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-15", "titleId": "/title/tt9214832/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "KittyG26", "userId": "/user/ur44557538/"}, "authorRating": 4, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6143703575109468, "id": "/title/tt9214832/userreviews/rw5489362", "interestingVotes": {"down": 20, "up": 53}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "It looks gorgeous - fashions, interiors, etc - and it has a good cast.

It is difficult, admittedly, within the space of a two-hour movie to show character development and to do justice to the subplots, consequently some aspects of the story seemed very rushed. Yet the director wastes valuable screen time showing people walking down corridors, strolling about in the grounds, etc. Also - huge problem here - Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn (both good actors) have a serious lack of on-screen chemistry.

The odd choir singing is a case in point.\n\nI could not like Emma herself. Anya Taylor-Joy was miscast, in my opinion. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was her unusual eyes? I know I disliked her hairstyles intensely. Horrid! I couldn't connect with her character.\n\nI thought some of the characters were wishy washy. You would not know that Emma's sister Isabella is married to Mr Knightly's brother John. Or perhaps I blinked & missed it? Jane Fairfax was fairly insipid & there was not much to indicate that Frank Churchill was a bit of a cad weaving elaborate lies. Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was too childish & effeminate for my liking. Mr Knightly, whilst likeable, was a bit childish for his age & station & not a match for this particular Emma & I could picture her walking all over him.\n\nThe actors I did enjoy were the characters of Mrs Weston, Harriet Smith & Miss Bates, played by Gemma Whelan, Mia Goth & Miranda Hart. Gemma Whelan of Game of Thrones fame, handled Mrs Weston with dignity & grace. Harriet was delightful & suitably innocent & gullible. My favourite character in this adaption was Miranda Hart's portrayal of the unfortunate Miss Bates. Miranda is an expert at playing socially awkward characters & did not disappoint with Miss Bates. Her embarrassment & vulnerability at Emma's spiteful words at the picnic brought me to tears. As did her graciousness in accepting Emma's attempt at an apology.

And I was not disappointed. It is a simply sublime piece of comic entertainment.\n\nEmma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a rich, privileged 21 year-old looking after her elderly and quirky father (Bill Nighy) in the family stately home. She has never loved, despite the persistent presence of 'family friend' George Knightley (Johnny Flynn), but finds it entertaining to engage in matchmaking, particularly in respect to her somewhat lower class friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth). Emma has high ambitions for Harriet... ideas significantly above what her social station and looks might suggest.\n\nEmma has her sights on a dream.... the mystery man Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), son of wealthy local landowner Mr Weston (Rupert Graves). She has never actually met him, but is obsessed with his myth. #fangirl. As a source of immense annoyance to her, but often a source of valuable information on news of Churchill, is the village 'old maid' Miss Bates (Miranda Hart). \"Such fun\"!\n\nBut Emma's perfect life is about to face sticky times, as her machinations fail to yield the expected results and a stray comment, at a disastrous picnic, threatens to damage both her reputation and her social standing.\n\nIf you like your movies full of action and suspense, you are digging in the wrong place. \"Emma\" is slow... glacially slow... wallowing in beautiful bucolic scenes (with superb cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt); gorgeous costumes by Alexandra Byrne; and hair styling by Marese Langan.\n\nThe movie also benefits from a joyfully tight and funny script by debut screenwriter Eleanor Catton (a Man-Booker prize winner). This picks relentlessly at the strata of the class system set up by Jane Austen's novel: \"Every body has their level\" spits spurned suitor Mr Elton (Josh O'Connor).\n\nI know Anya Taylor-Joy as the spirited Casey from \"Split\" and \"Glass\": she was impressive in \"Split\"; less so for me in the disappointing \"Glass\". But here, I found her UTTERLY mesmerising. She has such striking features - those eyes! - that she fully inhabits the role of the beautiful heiress who haunts multiple men sequentially. I even muttered the word \"Oscar nomination\" at the end of the film: though we are too early in the year to seriously go there.\n\nAn even bigger surprise was the actor playing George Knightley. Johnny Flynn has been in a number of TV shows I haven't seen, and a few films I haven't seen either (e.g. \"Beast\"). But I had the nagging feeling I knew him really well. The illustrious Mrs Movie Man clocked him: he's the Cineworld \"plaid man\"! (For those outside the UK or not patrons of Cineworld cinemas, he was the 'star' of a Cineworld advert that played over and Over AND OVER again for months on end before every film I saw. Arrrgggghhhh!).\n\nHere, Flynn is excellent as the frustrated and brooding Austen-hunk. He even gets away with an ar*e-shot within a U-certificate!\n\nParticularly strong in the supporting cast are Bill Nighy (being delightfully more restrained in his performance); Miranda Hart (being \"Miranda\", but perfectly cast) and Mia Goth (memorable for that eel-bath in \"A Cure for Wellness\").\n\nAnd a big thank-you for a web review in the online Radio Times for naming one of the comical (and bizarrely uncredited) footmen as Angus Imrie - - the truly disturbed stepson of Claire in \"Fleabag\". It was driving me crazy where I knew him from!\n\nThe one criticism I would have is that I found the (perfectly fine and well-fitting) music, by David Schweitzer and Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe) poorly mixed within the soundtrack. There were times when I found it overly intrusive, suddenly ducking under dialogue and then BLASTING out again. Sometimes music should be at the forefront.... but more often it should be barely perceptible.\n\nAs you might guess.... ...I loved this one. The story is brilliant (obsv!); the film is simply gorgeous to look at; the locations (including the village of Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds and Wilton House - near me - in Salisbury) are magnificent and a blessing for the English Tourist Board.\n\nAll the more impressive then that this is the directorial feature of video/short director Autumn de Wilde.\n\nThis comes with a \"highly recommended\" from both myself and the illustrious Mrs Movie-Man.\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web.)", "reviewTitle": "Simply Sublime.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-21", "titleId": "/title/tt9214832/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "debdshaw60", "userId": "/user/ur33809901/"}, "authorRating": 2, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5490887148785453, "id": "/title/tt9214832/userreviews/rw5546362", "interestingVotes": {"down": 5, "up": 16}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Emma is one of my favorite Jane Austin novels.

Some of the design may even be thought to be over the top, but I thought that was consonant with the mannered approach of the cast, an approach which works well in making this essentially a comedy of manners as well as a love story. The detective story element of the novel doesn't go for very much - little is made of the piano, and Frank Churchill's slip in knowing about Dr Perry's carriage is omitted.\n\nI thought Mia Goth's well-rounded performance of Harriet the best I have seen, and it is certainly difficult to take one's eyes off Anya Taylor-Joy in the titular lead. Other female performances are perhaps more so-so, although Chloe Pirie's harassed Isabella is interesting. The comedic Mr Elton would be well over the top in some adaptations but just about fits in here. Other male roles are adequately filled even though the portrayal of john Knightly is slightly bizarre.

This version of Emma is no exception as its faults are egregious. I could tell almost straight away it was going to be gimmicky in the way that filmmakers of dubious merit think they can add bits of business to wonderful classics, or distort things completely, as an \"improvement\". I fantasize that, in a better world, there might be some court to hear applications to make screen adaptations, to determine whether the filmmaker actually understands what it is about the story and the characters that give these works of literature their timeless appeal. So often they don't, as they change and destroy what is so fundamental to the success of the original. Somebody give them a \"Cliff's Notes\" to read, at the very least! Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of \"Emma\" is a likeable, open-natured young woman, who has faults but learns to become a better person. That's in the novel, anyway. The Emma depicted in this film wears alternately an arrogant or sulky expression, seems to have selfish and nasty motives and thoroughly deserves to be taken down a peg, which more or less happens. Newsflash to the filmmaker - she is such an unpleasant person that I don't care. Mr Knightley is a calm, confident sophisticated man of the world, someone of deep and genuine feelings - and dead sexy with it. Johnny Flynn's version is a nice young man but something of a klutz. How does he even like this hardfaced Emma? - again you've lost me. I have to contrast the failure of the lead characters to pull their weight in delivering the story, with the Romola Garai/Jonny Lee Miller version where they got it so right. To carry on with the catalogue of \"wrongness\" in this version, Frank Churchill, an important and attractive character in the story, is presented by an actor lacking in looks and charm, a complete nonentity. To mention some minor characters, I fully expected Bill Nighy to ham it up with the Mr Woodhouse character, and he does. But why oh why do they have to make Emma's sister Isabella and brother-in-law John Knightley unpleasant and unhappy people - it's so wrong! While not a major theme, their domestic happiness is a beacon to Emma and Mr Knightley to follow their example, and recognize their destiny. I could go on - Harriet Smith isn't pretty, Miss Bates isn't talkative enough, and Mr Elton is a grinning gargoyle. If I pull myself up with an effort to acknowledge the positives of the film, there are beautiful landscapes and house interiors, and great costumes and hairstyles, real eye candy. The dialogue is reasonably respectful of the original. But I wasn't happy for a minute watching the film. I am entitled to have high expectations of a Jane Austen adaptation, and was majorly disappointed, so only a 4/10.", "reviewTitle": "Can't get the basics right", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-20", "titleId": "/title/tt9214832/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "harryhoustonastros", "userId": "/user/ur99126376/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4983584386676103, "id": "/title/tt9214832/userreviews/rw5491559", "interestingVotes": {"down": 16, "up": 29}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Fun, stylistic, and is basically everything I wanted from the film.

This was the last of Jane Austen's novels to be published and completed in her lifetime. Her last novel Persuasion was published posthumously after her death in 1817.\n\nThis 2020 film version of Emma stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma Woodhouse and she is very good as the snobby control freak who is trying to play matchmaker to her friend Harriet Smith also played very well by Mia Goth. The standout performance for me in this movie is Miranda Hart as Miss Bates as the kind hearted but overbearingly boring twittering Village spinster. Miranda Hart gives the character humour and colour and her performance is worth the price of seeing this good film. The male characters in this predominantly female dominated story apart from Bill Nighy as the eccentric and delightfully self obsessed humorous father of Emma and Josh O'Connor as Mr Elton The Village Vicar seemed to lightweight to me . The two romantic leads lacked charm and sex appeal to me Johnny Flynn as George Knightley looked a little scruffy and more suited to the role of Mr Robert Martin the good hearted farmer .Callum Turner also seemed lacking to me in his role as Frank Churchill the charming but deceitful potential suitor of Emma. Perhaps that was the intention of Autumn de Wilde another impressive female director to avoid well known male stars from stealing the limelight from the impressive women? Top 10/10 marks to the Production personnel on this version of Emma it's a joy to watch the Cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt ,Production Designer Kate Quinn, Art Director Alice Sutton, Set Director , Stella Fox (who did \"Judy\" Star Wars Episode V11,) and especially Costume Designer ,Alexandra Byrne ( Phantom of the Opera and Mary Queen of Scots) who should be nominated next year for an Oscar.\n\nIf you love the World of Jane Austen the frippery and foppery and that long lost past age of strict manners and snobbery of Georgian Society you're sure to love Emma . I couldn't help comparing Emma to the other recent period film set 60 years ahead in America Greta Gerwig's stunning version of \"Little Women\" with a character Jo March also not looking for marriage but with more a woman of substance than Emma.", "reviewTitle": "Beautiful Production but Emma's not a woman of substance", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-13", "titleId": "/title/tt9214832/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "thedollarsucks", "userId": "/user/ur38464621/"}, "authorRating": 2, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4357274103394893, "id": "/title/tt9214832/userreviews/rw5523292", "interestingVotes": {"down": 14, "up": 21}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Of course, we all love the Mr. Knightleys and Mr. Darcys that Jane Austen has brought into feminine romance.

What starts out as a maybe-funny movie, quickly turns into feeling like sitting in the audience of a cheap opera. Too much is staged (moving of figures, music).

Additionally, almost all scenes filmed outside are terrible in lighting or fail to communicate they season they are meant to represent. The ones filmed inside, however, are heavily overloaded and overcomposed. One good thing: the cast (apart from the lead) was pretty well chosen.

I recently watched the 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow in the leading role to get an idea of the story of the film going into this one. I love Anya Taylor-Joy so much. I've seen every one of her films apart from Marrowbone. I was so excited to see her in yet another period piece but this time in a sly comedy. I ended up really enjoying this film. Its got laughs, love, class, and even a deft touch of sadness.\n\n The film is about a a wealthy 21 year old girl named Emma, who meddles in the lives of those around her. She tries to set her friend up to a man she is not romantically attracted to. As time goes by Emma discovers that trying to fix peoples lives does not always work and then she herself becomes romantically inclined. Along the way Emma realizes how manipulative and haughty she is and the impact that it has on those who are around here. The film also stars Mia Goth, Johnny Flynn, and Bill Nighy.\n\n The attention to detail and the production and costume design are absolutely superb. The film is rich with its intricate detail to period and the nobility involved. The film also possesses vibrant cinematography and camerawork. Its a really nice film to look at in a technical aspect. Anya Taylor-Joy is a talent and she's fantastic in this role. Emma can be despicable at times but there's an allure to her character and you can not help but want to be around her. The performances all around are great. I love seeing Mia Goth getting meaningful work, and I've never seen Bill Nighy have such a keen eye for a chilly draft.\n\n The film just seems more attuned and in sync with Austen's novel than the 1996 version. It embodies a wide range of emotions and can be hilarious with no dialogue at all. The cast have good chemistry and Autumn de Wilde shows a great touch in her impressive directorial debut. I think this film was great fun and is something I want to check out again because I found great (Anya Taylor) joy watching this.\n\n The best part of my night though without a doubt is actually meeting the leading lady on the street after the premiere.

The main storyline unfolds around a boy named Otis. His mom is a sexual therapist, which makes sex and everything connected with it even harder for him to talk about. Ironically, Otis, who has very little experience and feels tremendously awkward when it comes to sex and relationship, is surprisingly good at giving advice on those subjects to others. Therefore, this edgy cool girl Maeve, who is, as most would say, way out of Otis' league recognizes his \"talent\" and encourages him to start a sex clinic inside school. And so that the story starts.\n\nCompared to other teen series and films found on Netflix, Sex Education may be the most substance-rich, but it lack innovative concepts and novel themes to be called a round work. So you get presented many important discussion that deal with homosexuality, family problems to far-reaching critical issues such as abortion. However, I found dealing with these conflicts often very clumsy and superficial. In many places I had wanted more depth and a more intensive handling of the individual topics. Instead, the discussions were kept to a minimum and barely picked up by the characters and packed into meaningful dialogues.\n\nAnother point of criticism was the often stereotypical portrayal of many protagonists and the entire social environment shown. So it seems almost a trend to be that just standing in the corner inconspicuous boy may someday have the girl of his dreams. I do not doubt that there are such social structures or at least similar ones in every school and in almost every life of a 16 or 17-year-olds. But the creators of the series could have trusted more and to be able to present a story without the obvious presence of such clich\u00e9s. There are some clich\u00e9s, but it has no special effect on the whole. Even at its lamest, cliche moments, this quirky show remains quaintly entertaining. In many series or films for similar target groups, puberty, first love and first sex are often portrayed romantically and therefore often appear unrealistic. Sex education, however, shows a blunt and sincere approach and may perhaps convince one or the other viewers of this uniqueness.\n\nI believe it's important to see this series. It opens a subject about sexual developments of teenagers that should not be ignored. It also shows how everybody has their problems and nobody is perfect, and that there is an explanation to everything. We can see the fact that everything happens for a reason, that everything has a start somewhere and that if we as a community help to find that start, we can also help one to get rid of their issues, feel full as a person and happy with who they are.\n\nIn terms of acting performance, Sex Education painted a picture similar to own. The individual performances were in some cases quite authentic and convincing. However, some protagonists were so over-cliched in my eyes that the performance of the actors had to suffer as well. So you may praise some protagonists for their performance, others were not particularly prominent and therefore not very credible.\n\nAlthough most of the time the viewer will know what the stories are all about, \"Sex Education\" is the first pleasant surprise of the production year. With consistent and clever ideas, playful performers and a lot of charm, this coming-of-age comedy with adult audiences should be a reliable \"binge watching\" candidate for many. \"Sex Education\" was certainly not a bad series and could also take some positive points with its open-hearted nature. 8/10", "reviewTitle": "It's Fun and Sweet!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-01-20", "titleId": "/title/tt7767422/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "cpainter1-4-578820", "userId": "/user/ur52809353/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6046145433228826, "id": "/title/tt7767422/userreviews/rw5451668", "interestingVotes": {"down": 6, "up": 22}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I am an 80 year old retired psychologist and I am totally enchanted with each and every one of these characters.

Sorry in advance for any misspellings. I'm a tired swede, sue me.\n\nIn the first three episodes, I was really into it. The story seemed promising, Mando was awesome, and it really felt like the mandalorian could be something special. Then I saw episode four, and realized that it's gonna be \"one of those series.\" It gave me a kind of early Supernatural feeling, in the sense that they go from place to place, meeting and saying goodbye to people that never really make an impact or contribute to the story. Since I thought this would be more like a for example Stranger Things type of series, where the plot is very evident, I was a bit disappointed I guess.\n\nThe script also seemed more awkward, I got really confused about the decisions the characters made. By the end of it, I wasn't as excited to see what would happen in the next episode as I was before.\n\nWhen I watch a movie/series I want to know things like where the story is going, what the protagonist's goal is and who the antagonist is, but now I have no clue. Like, what exactly is Mando's plan? How is he going to stop all the trackers from revealing baby yoda's location? And WHY is he leaving baby yoda unprotected all the time if he wants him safe + he's being targeted???\n\nI guess the best way to describe what I'm feeling is by making a video game reference. It feels like the main story arc is being ignored, and we're witnessing the side quests. I get that it's fun to do them, cause it builds character, makes you discover more about the world, and all that jazz. But I can safely say that almost everyone over the age of 6 already knows A LOT about both mandalorians and the star wars universe. The first three episodes were a great introduction as well to those who doesn't, so why not just crack on with the main plot?\n\nI've only gotten to episode five (arguably a better episode than episode four, but still feels a bit stale), and there are four more episodes to come, which gives me hope that maybe it'll get better. Only time will tell I guess. Maybe my rating will have changed when I'm done with this season.\n\nThat was my little rant, lol.", "reviewTitle": "Started off great, not sure now", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-12-06", "titleId": "/title/tt8111088/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "hslay", "userId": "/user/ur59789624/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5326682315193083, "id": "/title/tt8111088/userreviews/rw5265137", "interestingVotes": {"down": 71, "up": 109}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I got to say this is more entertaining than the last 2 Star wars movies.

It would be told in 3 or 4 episodes; hence the need to stretch it out with filler episodes.\n\nSadly, we don't see the Mandalorian's face except in one scene; so character development and empathy is a tough call. Why don't we see him eat, sleep, wash his face without the helmet? Instead the only thing we get are flashbacks to explain how he is potentially suffering below his helmet.\n\nWe know he hates droids. But after being bandaged one time by a droid he gets all emotional about him. Isn't this a bit too much of a change of mind?\n\nThe other characters stay mostly bland.

All by doing what the other two trilogies couldn't do, by recapturing the feeling of the being in the Original Universe. Those movies felt completely separate universes and places from the one we'd known.\n\nThe Mandalorian has that feeling in spades. It feels so connected to Star Wars in a way most of the other movies couldn't. The place looks and feels real. Feels like the lawless chaos of a galaxy at war the originals always carried.\n\nThe characters don't invite you to like them, they just go about this tough galaxy, surviving any way they can.\n\nThe characters are deeply interesting, and are full of myth and lore of their own, away from Jedi. This mythology is also not explained neatly, or offered to you in a grand piece of exposition. It's hinted at, sometimes only in the visuals. Yet the mythology feels connected to everything that feels Star Wars.\n\nKudos to the creators. It's a wonderful show if you're an original Star Wars fan.

Roth, perhaps America's most important novelists, would be pleased.", "reviewTitle": "On- and Off-Screen Brilliance", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-17", "titleId": "/title/tt9308346/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "paul-allaer", "userId": "/user/ur48675674/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.29117675699108064, "id": "/title/tt9308346/userreviews/rw5557644", "interestingVotes": {"down": 24, "up": 18}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "\"The Plot Against America\" (2020 release; 6 episodes of about 60 min. each) brings an alternative history of the US. As the series opens, we are in \"Hoboken, NJ, June 1940\", and we get to know a Jewish family, the Levins. Dad (Herman) is working his way up in the life insurance business and is in line for a promotion that would allow them to buy a house and move to a better neighborhood. On the radio we hear a thunderous speech from American icon Charles Lindbergh, whom the Republicans have recruited to run for president against Roosevelt and whose views are outright anti-semitic and pro-Nazi, much to the dismay of Herman... At this point we are 15 min. into the opening episode but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this mini-series is the work from Ed Burns and David Simon, who brought us the acclaimed \"The Wire\". Here they bring the 2004 Philip Roth novel of the same name to the screen. I have not read the novel and hence I don't know how closely the mini-series sticks to the book. Surely the overall basic premise is the same: an alternative history of the US, in which an anti-semite/pro-Nazi candidate runs for president and wins. Of course there have been similarly themed shows before, as \"The Man In the High Castle\" immediately comes to mind (in which the Nazis win WWII and how that plays out in the US). This opening episode is setting the table of how all of it will play out, and does so quite effectively. After hearing Lindbergh's insidious speech, Herman laments \"Win or lose, there's a lot of hate out there, and he knows how to tap into it\". You don't need to be a genius to see how this perfectly fits into the current political climate, and that is the strength of the opening episode: it builds up gradually and it makes you worry, and worry a lot. As to the production value: it is clear that money was not an obstacle as this is an eye-pleasing production from start to finish (I mean, how many cars from that era can you put in a single frame?). The cast is tops, and it wasn't until the episode's end credits rolled that I realized that Evelyn is played by none other than Winona Ryder!\n\n\"The Plot Against America\" premiered this week on HBO and is now available on HBO On Demand and other streaming services. New episodes air on Monday evenings 9 pm. I personally can't wait to see how all of this will play out. If you have an interest in \"what if\" stories on a grand (and political) scale, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.", "reviewTitle": "Intriguing opening episode promises explosive mini-series (with Winona Ryder alert!)", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-17", "titleId": "/title/tt9308346/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Siddhartha14", "userId": "/user/ur46761872/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.2758043676312174, "id": "/title/tt9308346/userreviews/rw5557725", "interestingVotes": {"down": 34, "up": 22}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "So far, I am completely unimpressed with this series.

And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.\n\nDespite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).\n\nI am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips.

Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job directing, I think this is his best work to date. Robert De Niro is not given much screen time, but he takes advantage of the time he's given, and he shines. The costume design and makeup is great as well, and I think it should be nominated for a major award. The script is incredible, I'm going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days. The violence in this movie was not even that bad, compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy. I would like to take a minute and say, that films and other media do not cause violence, this is not a \"dangerous film.\" The last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane, I won't be able to forget them. The death scene on the Murray Franklin Show, is absolutely crazy, and I did not see it coming. Despite the fact that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mass murderer, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character at times. I didn't forgive him for the things he did, but at the same time, I did sympathize with him. I really liked the progression of Arthur's character. You see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by. The runtime was perfect it never felt boring.

A great deep and moving story, a life journey of a man who's suffering from some psychological issues and how neglect, bullying and rudeness by other human being can push a man to complete madness.\n\nAlthough it's not accurate to any comic book adaptation or any TV series or movie before it, yet it's a fresh and unique take on the character of the clown prince of crime from a realistic approach and I believe with Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance as the Joker in which he managed to bring a real life look-alike early version of the Joker which although is not comic book accurate but I feel it's a very decent foundation for Joker 2 which should be more true to heart of the original version of our lovable villain.\n\nThe movie is over all a great piece of filmmaking in all of its aspects. From the plot which was very interesting, believable and many can relate to it, through the acting which was impressively splendid to the directing which was outstanding. My main take on the movie is the lack of any positive lead character, I know we live in a tough world which full of negativity but there are some positive examples here and there and to shed some light on one or two characters in this movie would've been a nice positive thought.\n\nThe Joker movie can be misunderstood by many thinking it'll inspire crime and violence but I believe on the contrary that many who go through hard life will feel sympathy for the Joker character, others will even relate to his misery and may justify his actions. I believe the movie is meant to be a wake up call for many!

I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.\n\nBut...\n\nThere wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews. What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\n\n Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull. Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\n\n In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking.

Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.\n\nIf I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.\n\nThe cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.\n\nThe score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.\n\nMy biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.\n\nI wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.\n\nOverall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.\n\nFinal Grade - 9/10", "reviewTitle": "Don't (forget to) smile.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-01", "titleId": "/title/tt7286456/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "harkap", "userId": "/user/ur67754882/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6193868397035429, "id": "/title/tt7286456/userreviews/rw5394282", "interestingVotes": {"down": 91, "up": 190}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Do not really understand all the tens here.

Too bad for them, but it's their loss.\n\nSchitt's Creek grew on me episode by episode, so much so that I binge-watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix over a weekend! Once in, I couldn't leave!

I am now watching series 5 and will be awaiting the sadly final series come January 2020 (I hope).\n\nI read too many negative reviews from people whining about CBC nepotism and the fact that Dan Levy got a job on this show through his father, so please take note: Dan Levy is the creator of Schitt's Creek, so it could be said he gave his father this job. Together they put this show together, and by bothering to read the credits it's clear that Dan wrote and directed (I think) many of the episodes.\n\nOn top of that, he plays David brilliantly! His sweetness, fashion obsession, insecurity, need for approval and wit are so cleverly played. People complaining about Dan Levy and his facial expressions: Hello! Those are part of his brilliant performance as David. All the characters express so much with just a glance, an eyebrow twitch or the sardonic curl of a lip -- words aren't even necessary with actors this accomplished! Daniel Levy: you have brought joy to my heart with your writing and portrayal of David Rose!\n\nAlexis Rose is annoying, dreadfully so at first. But she learns, she evolves, she grows as time passes. As does David. They are very believable as brother and sister, even sometimes displaying similar mannerisms and expressions. Such clever writing, acting and directing.\n\nI have laughed out loud watching Schitt's Creek. I have felt delighted, annoyed, surprised, cringey, charmed and deeply touched.

At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it.

As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.\n\nAnd now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.\n\nThinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.\n\nAnd boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.\n\nShelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.\n\nHenry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. \"I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,\" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, \"You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford.\" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.\n\nCars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.\n\nFord v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment.", "reviewTitle": "\"I had no idea.

Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.\n\nFollowing multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.\n\nIf you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.\n\nIn the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive.

What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it. The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself.

Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's \"Grand Prix\" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's \"Rush\" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's \"Le Mans\" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to suggest that \"Le Mans '66\" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.\n\nThe film was marketed as \"Ford v Ferrari\" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if \"Le\" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (\"James Bond does not drive a Ford\". \"That's because he's a degenerate!\" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem\"). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.\n\nShelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!\n\nWhat's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.\n\nAt a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.\n\nIn many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.\n\nThis is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.\n\nBale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.\n\nThere's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in \"A Quiet Place\").\n\nWhere the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (\"Walk the Line\"), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.\n\nIf I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a \"boo-hiss\" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.\n\nJames Mangold (\"Logan\"; \"Walk the Line\") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a \"car movie that's not for me\". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.\n\nAbove all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide.

The Village. Figured it out. Many others. The Sixth Sense and Fight club got me and that's why I love them. I love to be taken down a path and then realize everything wasn't as it seems.\n\nWhen the fireman lit the cigarette I realized it was 1980. But I still didn't get that those three would be raised together until the nursery with the knit onesies. I'm good at this stuff and the acting and characters blew me away that I wasn't looking for it. \n\nBest Pilot ever. IMHO.\n\nThen I thought. Well they can't do that every episode because if you are looking for twists you find them. If I was told there was a twist at the end, I would have figured it out (everyone's birthday on the same day, etc). But the fact one was black and the other two were twins threw me. PLUS the fact one was \"Ryan Gosling\" body and the other was overweight threw me that they were twins. Both played on stereotypes which I Loved they made us look into ourselves a little.\n\nSo where does the show go from here? It has a great premise. Dual time lines. You can do a lot with that. Have stories play out with flashbacks to tell a larger story (ala Lost). The casting was nailed with exceptional talent. I was interested in every character. They even nailed it by casting Simon and Simon vet Gerald McRaney. He was the glue that MADE that story line click. He speech on the chair was Emmy worthy. I hope he is a regular cast member and explore his wife's death and the death of his one child.\n\nI'm hooked for at least season one. No need for twists. The dual time lines and great characters is enough for me. They can bounce all around in the 80s when the \"triplets\" are 4 or 10 or 15. triple time lines or more. Milo and Mandy can be made to look older and cast kids to play the parts at different ages. So much room to explore. I predict a good 4-7 year run.", "reviewTitle": "Best Pilot in ages.

The acting is ok (The actor who plays Jake is definitely the best one). What started off as a 10/10 show is now headed towards a 2/10. I even managed to watch some episodes of season 3, and it was a bad idea to keep it going because the rating is gonna drop a lot. They should have stopped at season 2 heck season 1.

The film does very little to try to explain where these beings come from, all we know is how long they've been there for and that they have change the face of the planet in a pretty radical way.\n\nWe follow the Abbot family, who lives in a remote country house with an elaborate system to keep each other safe, but the main thing is that they have become very skilled at being very quiet.\n\nThe incredible result of that premise is that the film has very little dialogue and instead, makes great use of visuals and sound. And there are truly stunning set pieces in this film, and without spoiling anything, Emily Blunt gives a stellar performance, as usual. \n\nFrustratingly, because the film chooses to concentrate on the action and the premise, it failed to give real substance to its characters and their relationships. A very artificial conflict is created between the dad and his daughter, and it truly feels like it was added into a later version of the script to give some sort of emotional arc to the characters, but the result is clumsy at best, a bit ridiculous at worst.\n\nAdditionally, the film fails to create very clear rules on what the creatures can and cannot hear, how they function, how they are able to detect obstacles in their path, how many there are, or how fast they move, are all animals dead, and the list probably goes on. The result is that whatever is established at one point inevitably changes later on to fit the dramatic needs of the story, but it undermines our ability to suspend disbelief. Repeatedly, it feels like the film is doing its best to thrill, even if that means going against the film's internal logic. \n\nOn a similar note, around the middle of the film John Krasinski takes his son hunting. At some point, they stop by a waterfall, next to which Krasinski starts yelling, casually explaining to his son that as long as there is a louder sound next to them, they are absolutely safe. I was thinking the same thing during the first half of the film, namely - if these creatures follow sounds, then, wouldn't it be simple to constantly distract them with sounds everywhere? We certainly have the technology to do that. Also, shouldn't there be sound proof shelters? Couldn't all humanity focus on sound proofing all of their homes??\n\nBut even if we accept for one second that these solutions are impossible, then, why not move next to a waterfall or any other natural place that is always very loud?? Plus, it doesn't look like they are able to shower at all, a waterfall would make a lot of sense hygiene wise.\n\nI understand that this is a movie and sometimes internal logic needs to be sacrificed, but this became a tough sell after that moment and it felt like the film did very little to address that glaring problem.", "reviewTitle": "A great concept with frustrating choices", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2018-04-10", "titleId": "/title/tt6644200/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Aaron_Kyle", "userId": "/user/ur78137797/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6816162948662263, "id": "/title/tt6644200/userreviews/rw4506144", "interestingVotes": {"down": 97, "up": 262}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "A Quiet Place is a flawed film with many illogical decisions but non major enough to be considered brainless.\n\nThe films main flaw are its own creatures (who kill whatever makes a sound) and the lack of explanation behind them makes the concept fell rushed.

We know they've become skilled at being quiet and we know they live on a farm in the countryside. Inside their house is a basement which muffles the sound yet the family doesn't use until \u00be in the movie. Other illogical flaws beg a few questions; Why doesn't the family have a house near the river?

All the actors, especially Emily Blunt give realistic enough performances.\n\nUltimately A Quiet Place fails at being scary and is quite illogical at times but its tense enough to be entertaining and its originality are a nice change of pace for horror/thrillers good enough for a second viewing.\n\nFinal Grade: 7/10", "reviewTitle": "Original", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2018-12-11", "titleId": "/title/tt6644200/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "slivka_c", "userId": "/user/ur27732398/"}, "authorRating": 3, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6571993597349498, "id": "/title/tt6644200/userreviews/rw4791482", "interestingVotes": {"down": 52, "up": 137}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I had to comment the whole time while watching this movie.

Other reviews give a good overview of the plot, I'm not looking to do that here. I just want to point out some plot inconsistencies and/or the lack of critical thinking that the characters demonstrate. I will list a few of my observations below. \n\n1. They go to a waterfall where they can scream as loud as they want and the monsters can't hear them. Why not live there? They could fish and collect drinking water near the river. The monsters would probably stay away from the area since the sound of the falls would impede their hunting ability. \n\n2. When taking a walk, does anyone seriously let the youngest child of the group walk behind them. Why on earth would they let a young boy walk a hundred yards behind the adults in such a dangerous situation. They can't even correct the boy if he makes any mistakes, and indeed this results in his death. \n\n3. How on earth did they get the corn planted? By hand? After 400+ days you wouldn't see corn in nice little neat rows like it was planted by farm equipment. \n\n4. Since the monsters can't hear you if there is a loud sound nearby, why not bring out one of the downstairs speakers and blast something 24/7 on one of the nearby trees or on top of the house? The monsters would get used to the sound and leave the area alone, leaving the family to talk in peace. \n\n5. What human with a brain wouldn't consider making a soundproof room. They could go to the city, get a bunch of foam, blankets, pillows, whatever, and plaster it around one of the larger rooms until they created an effective sound barrier. In the movie, a single mattress pulled over a walkway is an effective sound shield. Imagine how effective they could be if they put some ACTUAL effort into soundproofing the room. \n\n6. Apparently the monsters can be killed by shotguns? The entire military was wiped out, with all the weaponry of the finest military in the world rendered useless against the monsters, but Emily Blunt shoots one in the head and kills it? Right. \n\n7. The mother, Emily Blunt, is pregnant. Why would you bring a newborn child into this world, when the child will surely jeopardize the safety of the entire family. You know that babies cry right? Pull out or use a condom. \n\n8. If the monsters can hear the faintest sound from far way, why do they have trouble hearing sounds that even humans can decipher at close range. A baby crying, a mother's heavy breathing, a persons heartbeat. All of these things would be loud to a creature that hear can hear footstep from a half mile away. \n\n9. The mother's water breaks and she starts having the baby. She tries to contain her gasps and walks downstairs only to step on a nail on the stairway. She lets out a sound and falls, causing the monsters to hunt her down and nearly kill her and the newborn child. However, just in time, she is saved by fireworks designed to distract the monsters. Instead of removing the nail like any sane person, they just ignore it and leave it sticking up on the stairs for someone else to step on. Dumb. \n\nThis movie isn't terrible, with great acting and a pretty unique backstory. But the glaring logical fallacies and the idiocracy of the characters made the movie completely unwatchable for me. The monsters don't really seem that formidable after further inspection, and if the family followed any of the tips I mention, they could live with little difficulty.", "reviewTitle": "Great Movie if you turn off your Brain", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2018-04-15", "titleId": "/title/tt6644200/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "andrewjens-336-975762", "userId": "/user/ur32947359/"}, "authorRating": 4, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6046795956077023, "id": "/title/tt6644200/userreviews/rw4120929", "interestingVotes": {"down": 603, "up": 1020}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This film is a classic case of \"we just have to make a film about that premise\", however what the people involved didn't do well is figure out how to cover all the plot holes the premise was always going to introduce.\n\nThe introduction is moving and sets up the premise well, however I started to realise the lack of care that would be taken later in the film when I realised that I was being asked to believe that a four-year-old (left to walk by himself at the rear of a family in a dangerous situation) could get two batteries inserted in a toy. Even if the kid could do it, the chances would be only one in four of getting the batteries oriented correctly. Why didn't the creature come back to hunt the father based on the sound of his running footsteps?\n\nSo it's possible to kill the creatures with a gun? Okay, then ... with gun ownership in the US being about one per capita, surely the creatures would have been wiped out long ago by having provided the population with the target practice they must secretly crave?\n\nSo a family with kids survived whatever (unexplained) apocalypse occurred prior to the film's beginning, but the army didn't?\n\nSo the creatures have no vision and super-sensitive hearing? What about a sense of smell?\n\nSo no one talks in their sleep or snores (or has farts)? Do toilets flush?\n\nSo the creatures can rip though a metal grain silo, but not instantly get into a truck to get at the two kids inside? And out of interest, how do you harvest a field of corn without making a sound? How do you remove the kernels of corn from the cobs and get them into the silo?\n\nSo they have to play Monopoly with crocheted pieces (to avoid noise), but the sound of a truck rolling down a hillside is okay?\n\nI think that would be shortest labour in history. I'm pretty sure the timeline in the movie is continuous enough to prove that she only had three or four contractions. None of that annoying 30-hour stuff for her!\n\nWould the hearing aid really have broadcast with enough power in the right frequencies to affect the creatures that much? Would those frequencies have been reproduced by the microphone system? Who knows? Perhaps. To be honest, I find the similar resolution based on the playing of Slim Whitman's \"Indian Love Call\" in the film \"Mars Attacks!\" to be almost as believable.\n\nWhy not spend most of your time living behind the waterfall?

It has a unique premise and backstory. The setup for the story has been done well. The performances by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the child actors is awesome. The direction of Krasinski is \"awesomer\". The tension and the thrills were genuinely great. That's something I have not seen in a horror/thriller for a long time. Speaking of horror, what we take as \"scary\" is totally subjective. If you're watching this to get some jumpscares or to see a ghost, this ain't your movie. There are many moments that give us the feeling of getting into the jaws of death, unexpectedly. Those were some real thrills. And, the characters know what's gonna kill them and why. So, whenever such things take place, the tension is amplified (no pun intended) and whether or not they are gonna succeed at the particular moment keeps you terrified. For me, anything that keeps you terrified is real horror than some ghosts and jumpscares, so I got my \"horror\" part in this movie, after a long time. It's not that it doesn't have any false scares, just one or two though. Whenever something goes wrong, you can feel the s**t happening. That's some incredible directing. It's just an awesome thrill ride until we reach the third act, where things just turn into the same old \"daddy loves you\" things and the final moments were a bit less satisfying for a thrill ride we witnessed for the majority of the movie. There are some notable plot holes regarding a \"better\" place they should've lived on, some sounds making no significance in the context of the movie's own rules, the way a lot of food, medicines don't get used up after such a long time, the crops being harvested (without any noise?) etc. The movie also shows certain stuff as if it was trying to say \"see this is a plot device, see see SEE!\" and it actually is so. One plotline with Emily Blunt and her \"youngest child\" was something that made no sense to be honest as per the movie's own rules and was obvious to play out in the later part of the movie. The way it was playing out was damn good, but we knew that something was up regarding this. That's all I can say and have to say about this movie, without spoiling anything. If you watch the movie, you'll know what I am pointing at. On the whole, I cannot overlook the flaws but man, I had a great time watching the movie. It's flawed but intriguing. It's probably the first Krasinski movie I liked so much. I have seen one or two other movies he made, some years ago. They were forgettable to say the least.

This is an example of extremely lazy script writing. I'm kind of shocked that so many people are saying this movie was great. I saw Chris Pratt on Instagram raving about this movie and urging his followers to go see it. As I sat in the theater, I was so distracted by the constant glaring plot holes that I found the movie extremely frustrating and boring. If you are paying attention to the movie as you watch it, you will find it impossible to take serious. SPOILERS AHEAD!  The monsters key on sound, right? But we learn about halfway through the movie that there is a nearby waterfall, the sound of which is sufficient to mask the sounds that the monsters would normally key on. Uh, so, why not just move the family right next to the waterfall (where is also where they fish for food) and just camp out there? Pretty stupid. OK, next, the dad has the farm rigged with tons of lights. Just, lights strung up all over the fields. Where does he get the electricity for all those lights? Not to mention his little technology lab down in the basement. No generator? Is there a generator? If there is, how does he keep it fueled and how does he keep it from making noise? The monsters can be easily fooled with a kitchen timer, right? So, seems to me that it would be pretty easy to set traps for these things. Or, at the very least, how about rigging up noise makers? You know, you could power them with the apparently endless electricity they have? I could go on and on, but lets talk about the nail scene. I found this particularly frustrating. The nail is nailed DOWN in to the step, but the HEAD of the nail gets caught on Emily Blunt's laundry bag, and gets pulled up. The makes sense. But then, suddenly, the SHARP end of the nail is pointing UP. That makes no sense. Nails are not pounded UP in to the steps. The head of the nail would be up, which would probably hurt if you stepped on it in your bare feet, but it would penetrate. That nail scenario made absolutely no sense whatsoever. \n\nThese and many other glaring plot holes made this movie impossible to enjoy.

Pretty much the only things babies do is poop and make noise. So their plan is to put it in a sound proof box? For how long? The next 4 years of it's miserable life?

They wouldn't even need swords, I reckon they could have gotten the job done with sticks and rocks. \n\nWe are seriously meant to believe that aliens, with seemingly no sense of site or smell but incredibly hyperacuity of sound, beat humans? That is the first and primary stupid premise of this film. Sound is the easiest thing to manipulate, can be matched with opposing noise to cover and as we found out later they have an intensely disabling reaction to high pitched sound. SERIOUSLY? If we met creatures like that on an opposing planet, we would make them extinct. Set up a sound box, bring them in blow them up/shoot them when they get near. Put DOG WHISTLES on humans to disable them when routing the few stragglers, have loud speakers on an armoured vehicle whilst patrolling so they would attack that and the men could walk up close, change the pitch to very high and place his gun on its head for an easy kill. I mean honestly, the most manipulable sensation is the only one they have? And to add insult to injury, a shotgun blast clearly blows it's head open (so their armour or not so tough) and they emit electromagnetic pulses when getting near? There is no believable scenario in which these things would triumph over humans. I thought maybe these creatures had sonar capability, but no they are even more useless than bats.\n\nSecondly, the humans in this are so utterly stupid its not funny. So the backup plan to scatter the aliens away if they are on the farm..... light 5- fireworks to distract them for about 20 seconds. Something much easier- a remote speaker activated with an ipod? A FREAKING RADIO with remote switch? They have power in this film, yet this is the best thing they can think of?\n\nHis death was contrived nonsense too. The only thing he could think of was to scream to draw the alien away from his kid? How about throwing rocks/the pick he was holding AT THE GIANT METAL SHED BESIDE HIM? Also, WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING BUT GO TO AN OPEN FIELD WHEN THE CREATURES ARE CLOSE? You have a distinct advantage in site- running to a closed car COMPLETELY DISABLES this. Common sense would dictate when you think its close, crouch down, breath into your sleeve to reduce sound and keep eyes open. The alien will neither smell nor see you, and if you need to move that you can see it and go slowly, whilst trying to throw an object somewhere to make noise for a distraction. \n\nShe is heavily pregnant and they build a soundproof room that's NOT EVEN SEALED properly. They have a mattress that goes over the trap door? Ultra dumb and tries to set tension later in the film. It just screams laziness when a horror film has to build tension through dumb and pretentious means that no human would ever do.\n\nI could go on and on. This film is terribly lazy in building drama, uses jump scares all the time, cliched in the family 'unit' (there are seriously people here talking about the great dialogue??? This film had decisively little dialogue in it, and was utterly vanilla. They were all stereotypical family members, I bet not one person can name a quirk or unique character trait of any of them). The humans are stupid and the aliens are an incredibly flawed invader- Arnold from Predator could make a whole bunch of traps in the trees like he did in that film and wipe them all out in an afternoon.

I found it to be nerve shredding and so tense to watch i had to try catch my breath a few occasions as i had been holding it so long.

We've seen the limits of alien's ability, they couldve easily sound proofed it enough for normal life.

Not to mention if they were sound sensitive the FIRST solution the military would have tried would be variable frequencies and their effect.

I am fine with a film creating whatever rules or framework it wants. You want a film with Magic, fine. Supernatural powers, fine. Or a film where If any sound is made, the monsters attack in seconds and make lighting quick work of their prey, fine. \n\nThere is a lot I like about the film, but when you routinely break the very rules you create, the movie becomes frustrating and unenjoyable. \n\nIn this film the creators establish that sounds of a beeping space shuttle toy bring monsters in under 10 seconds. And they kill the living thing holding the toy so fast you barely see it. That's fast. Also, the sound of a falling silo door brings a monster, also in a very fast time. A scream will bring a monster in a matter of seconds. And kill you just as fast. Normal talking will also bring a monster so you must use sign language. Also, the sound of a raccoon just making normal night time noises will bring a monster to kill the raccoon. \n\nSo, how is it the loud sound of the same raccoon falling on the roof one minute before not bring the monster? How is it that the same raccoon, a full raccoon size, did not get killed every single day before the scene shown? Is he using raccoon sign language and forgot that night?  The silo door falling brings the monster but the roof noise from the raccoon does not? The roof noise was louder and the monster was clearly in the area because the monster killed the raccoon a moment later. \n\nHow is they show birds in the sky making noises early in the film, but no monster attack? Do the birds only make noise when flying? Do they ever nest? Of course they must land. Do they always stay quiet when they nest or land? How did the creatures not attack then? Birds are noisy but they survive. They monsters can easily and swiftly get to the top of a silo, why not a tree? They can cut through a silo wall, so why not a tree or whatever the birds are in?\n\n They establish that non-living things making noise bring the monster. The afore mentioned door, and also a gun, fireworks, etc. also, there is an object that falls that nearly hits the ground and the family shows their collective relief when it is caught before hitting the ground. Obviously, they are afraid a falling object will bring the monster. \n\nBut, a river or waterfall does not bring the monster. Maybe they attacked the river and gave up? If so, why not live a bit closer to the water. The rustling of leaves of a tree or corn stalks does not bring the monster, apparently? Leaves are alive. Why do they ignore that? The family can't make a creaking sound in the house because it will bring a monster, so they walk around barefoot. But, anyone who has lived in a home knows that homes make a random, creaking sound on their own from time to time. What happens then?. And the wind would make sounds against the house frequently. Of course, they have to live in a house with wood floors and no carpets or rugs to help muffle any sound, but take serious care to make the paths outside sound resistant to their feet. \n\nAlso, did no one cough during the last year? Does no one snore? What about flatulance? Surely someone must have had a good sneeze. These sounds are louder than a whisper and often louder than normal talking. Yet, they avoided the monster for over a year. And, why do they have to keep reminding people to be quiet by putting their finger over their mouths? You'd think after a year the people alive would have figured that one out. \n\nWhy do monsters ignore the creaking, rusted swing during the walk home with the dad and son? Because a creaking, rusted swing sounds erie and adds to tension? They also ignore the newspaper blowing in the wind at the beginning of the film, because why again? Is it Becasue a newspaper blowing in the wind sets a mood? \n\nThe monsters move incredibly fast, faster than any animal, but then move as slow as a sloth, painfully slow, when moving against the people the director does not want killed. \n\nThere are so many ways this movie could have been better. The concept is not bad, but the execution is frustrating. It's not a bad movie, and I enjoyed parts, but you must turn off your brain and ignore facts to give this anything more than a mild recommendation. \n\nI liked the actors and thought they did well with the material. I liked the family concept. You felt like everyone mattered and no one was expendable, except the old dude of course. \n\nThere are plenty of other things buggy about the movie but the lack of consistency is what really bothered me. I wanted the film to succeed and I found myself trying to make excuses for the story, making assumptions to try and explain how the story could work and be believable, but the inconsistencies were too much.

Starring James Marsden and Jim Carrey, it is a fast-moving adventure (obviously) that should entertain newcomers and keep fans of the original series satisfied.\n\nIn the small town of Green Hills, Montana, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) lives in hiding after being forced out of his original dimension due to his powers of super speed. After accidentally causing a blackout throughout the whole area, Sonic attracts the attention of Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey), an eccentric evil genius whom the government has hired to track Sonic down for experimental purposes. Now on the run once again, Sonic enlists the help of local police officer Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to aid him in avoiding capture and hopefully make a new friend in the process.\n\nEven if you aren't a hardcore fan of the series, Sonic The Hedgehog provides a nice amount of fun action and quirky humour to draw in even the most casual of moviegoer. I myself was a Nintendo kid growing up, preferring to play as the Italian plumber instead of the blue hedgehog, but SEGA and their mascot character always had my respect for being worthy rivals during the video game wars of the 90s, and the same can be said for this. In fact, this film seems to strongly acknowledge Sonic's 1990s roots, from his love of chili dogs to listening to music on a boombox. Of course, there are some references to modern trends but they are kept to a minimum likely so that the film will age better.\n\nJeff Fowler, who makes his directorial debut for a feature film, does a fine job juggling his storytelling duties with showing off some solid special effects along the way, especially on Sonic himself. It is well known by now that Sonic's original design for this film was poorly received by the public so it was decided that his overall look would be changed. This worked well in the film's favour as not only does he better resemble his video game self, but he even feels more naturally integrated into the real world. We watch as Sonic dashes around causing mischief and escaping danger through different environments like the big city or the quiet countryside, deriving enjoyment along the way. This led to some amusing Quicksilver/Deadpool-esque moments which provided great comic relief during several action scenes.\n\nComedian Ben Schwartz was a great pick to provide the voice and motion-capture of Sonic himself, both emanating the character's trademark cocky attitude while also showcasing his loneliness and longing for true friendship. This, in turn, makes him more relatable to the audience and causes him to have more human traits than some of the actual people in the film. James Marsden also gave a likeable performance as Tom Wachowski, not merely being relegated to the straight man role but also having his fair share of funny moments as well. However, it is Jim Carrey who steals the show as Dr. Robotnik. I'm not sure whether it was seeing how perfectly tailored the character was to his comedic talents or if it was just how nostalgic it felt to see him acting like his over-the-top 90s self again, but virtually everything he said and did had me laughing out loud. I hope we will see more of Carrey's portrayal of the character in the near future, which reportedly he has expressed interest in doing.\n\nIn the end, even though the film isn't groundbreaking by any means, it still provides much needed entertainment thanks to its respectful take on the source material that, like POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu before it, definitely feels more like how video games should be handled for the big screen treatment. There is certainly potential for other game franchises to be adapted into movies with a similar style and it is starting to feel as though the \"video game curse\" may be fading away altogether. There are two bonus mid-credit scenes worth staying back for, and while they aren't of Masahiro Sakurai approaching Sonic about the Smash initiative, they should excite fans of the series just as much.\n\nI rate it 7/10", "reviewTitle": "A fast-moving adventure (obviously) that should entertain newcomers and keep fans of the original series satisfied", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-13", "titleId": "/title/tt3794354/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "UniqueParticle", "userId": "/user/ur34836174/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4557909254354975, "id": "/title/tt3794354/userreviews/rw5486805", "interestingVotes": {"down": 17, "up": 26}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "So much fun throughout!

The plot is weak and the acting is mediocre and feels very cheesy at some scenes, the casting choices are way off the authenticity of the characters, as if they wanted to compile all races in one movie that no one feels left out with a complete neglect to the comic books or TV series authenticity...like their choice to go with the \"Asian\" choice of Cassandra Cain instead of Barbara Gordon, Batgirl. The scenes decoration is too colorful in a wrong manner, I can understand that a Harley Quinn movie should be colorful and chaotic but there's a huge difference between an artistic chaos, this is why the decoration of this movie feels like it was designed by a crazed extravagant fashion designer! while the directing was clearly all over the place.\n\nI'll never change my mind when I say that Margot Robbie is a poor choice for Harley Quinn character, she doesn't look like Harley - Harley has a round face while Margot has more of a square or a bit of an oblong face - she doesn't feel like Harley Quinn...Harley is a very dangerous, sadistic character...too dangerous that many times the Joker himself is scared of her, she even beat him up in many occasions.

I do not know what the screenwriter or director was thinking, but it wasn't about making a movie that had conscious cognizant coherence.\n\nFrom the get-go, this film is a mess. Using narrative and disjointed clips of film, to attempt to put the story in place and time was useless here because there really is no place or time.\n\nI thought \"Suicide Squad\" was a quirky fun movie and where we meet Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) for the first time. She was odd, \"out there,\" and on the edge of crazy. This film Birds of Prey is supposed to give us the backstory of Ms. Quinn. It is also a way to introduce other characters, the \"Birds of Prey,\" consisting of Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), \"The Huntress,\" aka Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and \"Black Canary,\" aka Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).\n\nThere's little character development, so they use some narration and snippets of past stories to fill in the backstory of these characters.\n\nThis group of women come together because of and over the improbability of a young pickpocketing girl, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), swallowing a large, I mean colossally large diamond stolen from a thieving, conniving, and self-named lord of Gotham, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor).\n\nLots of fighting ensues, and we always know who wins. The fighting scenes are not well-choreographed and felt staged. The logic stream of the story was virtually non-existent while it seemed as though the director Cathy Yan threw together a bunch of clips of film scraps she shot with this cast doing stuff and called it a day.\n\nRobbie is an excellent actress. She' has proven her abilities in many films. Therefore, I'm surprised she co-produced and acted in this hot mess. Despite her talents, this was not good work. Perez, who has been missed in recent years, did what she could with this limiting role. Winstead was the best of the lot. Her quiet demeanor and her story of how she came up with \"The Huntress\" was amusing when everyone else liked calling her \"Crossbow.\" Smollett-Bell tried to make her character mean something but, again, the script and direction let her down. McGregor was okay as the foil for the Birds of Prey. Christina Hodson created a disjointed and lackluster screenplay with little substance.

I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.\n\nHowever, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.\n\nOverall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad.

I would go so far as to say this first season is a dark representation of Seinfeld. Imagine if Seinfeld was released on HBO, how different of a show it would have been. Well, now Larry has that platform to really explore all opportunities \u0085 and he does with his hilarious show.\n\nIf you are a fan of awkward silences and coincidences with surprising results you will love this show. I am not sure if die-hard Seinfeld fans will love this program, but I sure did and I have seen every episode of Seinfeld at least twenty times. I will have to warn you, this is yet another show about nothing that just works. I just finished watching my favorite episode with the 'elevator courtesy' and his infamous fight with Richard Lewis (who plays his best friend).\n\nOverall, this is a very funny show that I hope remains true to itself and consistent throughout the seasons. I love Larry David's humor, and while it may not be for everyone, I do find that it is very realistic. It will open your eyes to the strange, odd world in which we live.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****", "reviewTitle": "He's a victim of circumstance.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2004-10-02", "titleId": "/title/tt0264235/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "glgioia", "userId": "/user/ur0970606/"}, "helpfulnessScore": 0.8109057997799798, "id": "/title/tt0264235/userreviews/rw0764681", "interestingVotes": {"down": 33, "up": 204}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "So what does Larry David do for an encore after the incredibly successful sitcom that detailed his experiences as a stand up in NY, he creates a new sitcom about his experiences as a very succesful creator of said show, post cancellation, living the good life with a ton of dough out in Malibu. Sounds pretty boring, and even snotty right? Its not at all. Like the rest of us, I loved Seinfeld, and still love the reruns. But I gotta say, this show is better. It's the same basic premise, which I guess is to turn a standup monologue into a situation comedy. In other words, instead of having a guy on stage telling jokes about the amusing and annoying happenstances of every day life, you create a format comedy, and use these anecdotes to weave together a plot. What made Seinfeld memorable was the clever way in which everything all in the end tied up in a nice little package. If you notice, that's a common laugh getter for stand-ups, to inject a joke they made earlier in their set and put it into practical anecdotal demonstration. You are right if you are thinking this is complete hogwash and hyper-analyzation of something not meant to be studied as such, but there it is. Having said all of that, I think CYE is the logical next step for fans of the Seinfeld show. It's the advanced course if you will of the more remedial network show. The freedom of HBO allows for obviously more adult material and language, but also for pure artistic expression. A lot of what goes on is definitely not palatable to the mainstream, and I could honestly see people hating it. Not me. I think its a rare chance to see genius, unfettered and uncensored. Yes Larry David was George Costanza or vice versa, but through this series, you also see he was Kramer, Elaine and Jerry. For some reason I totally relate to his inability to relate to everyone else, including his wife. Its often way too contrived, but I love it.

As I'm English, the usual classics like \"Friends\" and \"Seinfield\" don't tend to match out against things like \"The Office\" and \"Peep Show\". Now, it's probably because I'm British that I've developed these comedy tastes, but I am in no way against the sort of stuff the USA turn out. \"Scrubs\", \"Home Improvement\" and \"South Park\" are some of my favourite shows of all time, all funny in their own ways. Recently I invested in series one of a very different show, something that I thought I'd buy after seeing a few clips on a TV special. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is the king of sitcoms - and here's why.\n\nThe idea is simple. Larry David (writer and co-creator of Seinfield) plays himself as he goes from place-to-place on life's adventures with a great supporting cast, including his wife Cheryl and best friend Jeff. As he goes, realistic situations develop, and here lies the comedy; Larry says and does the exact opposite to what a normal person would do - in essence, he says what you'd be thinking instead of pretending to be humble, polite or well-mannered. Of course, Larry can be humble, polite and well-mannered, but only to those who treat him the same way.\n\nFirst off, the tagline \"deep down you know you're him\" is totally spot-on. The character of Larry is (secretly) somebody you know you are, it's just Larry tends to voice his opinion, state what's true and stand up for himself when things aren't his fault. Isn't this somebody we all wish we could be? I sure do, but it's Larry's lack of feelings for anybody but himself that sets him apart. Sure, he's a nice guy too - I'd be pals with him, and even more so for speaking his mind.\n\nOf course, the comedy develops from a variety of other areas too. Our poor protagonist is normally punished in some way for speaking his mind, as it seems you can't get through life by simply saying what's right. Take the first episode for instance, Larry jokingly refers to his wife as \"Hitler\" whilst on the phone to his friend Jeff - little did he know, he was on speaker phone and Jeff's parents have heard. They're outraged, and why? ...they've got a cousin who was a gay holocaust survivor. Geesh! That's just one example however, and as the series develops, the plots and little stories tend to get better and better. The characters are very, very well done - and you have to remember, a lot of the show is improvised from a simple script outline. The actors were auditioned with Larry David himself and it shows that he's put time and effort into getting the show perfect - it really does.\n\nIn a nutshell, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is as realistic as \"The Office\", and in the same way, a very similar show. Where \"The Office\" used cringe-comedy to get us laughing, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" gets us laughing at what we know is true. It's a look at a character who we can love and adore, and yet still distance ourselves from because deep down, we know we're him... we just don't want to admit it.", "reviewTitle": "Funny as ever, realistic as hell - one of the best sitcoms of all time.", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2006-01-16", "titleId": "/title/tt0264235/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "jhnbrennan171", "userId": "/user/ur37085396/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5657035830940078, "id": "/title/tt0264235/userreviews/rw2920503", "interestingVotes": {"down": 6, "up": 19}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This hilarious show is created and written by comedic genius Larry David (co creator of Seinfeld)who stars as a fictionalized version of himself and follows the daily life of the wealthy millionaire.

However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series. \n\nThe Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films.

This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered. \n\nThe characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable. \n\nProduction values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion. \n\nStranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end.

But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.\n\nI can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV.

Then season three came out I am thinking about how stupid it makes everybody look. Evil Russians? Really??? I get the whole 80's nostalgia thing they were trying to create, but they went full throttle and floored the accelerator and hit that 88 miles per hour and ended up with a ridiculous plot-line. The whole idea that \"Evil Russians\" somehow built a top-secret base without the Americans finding out is a bit insulting and unbelievable (even if I have to suspend belief I still can't ignore logic). This isn't a safe house for a few Russian spies to create a base of operations. This is a base with (at least) a couple of hundred Soviet soldiers and which is, apparently, so long that you need a cart to travel underground was all built without any detection of any American agency at the height of the Cold War. I would have assumed that the Agency responsible for opening the portal in the first place would have stuck around for at least a couple of years in Hawkins to make sure that nothing had been left behind... I don't know, something like a mobile goo (which when you really-really look at it resembles poo). The resources to build something like that would be a logistical nightmare even if they had built the mall. Try to remember that they tried to place nuclear missiles in Cuba and they got caught. Are they really going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an operation that may or may not work? Somehow, a bunch of kids just stumble into an elevator unnoticed by all the armed guards and cameras. Not only are the Soviets dumb enough to let anyone enter into their base they also use their Soviet military uniforms and weapons (like that is not going to attract attention at all...). There is no reason for the Russians to be in Hawkins and it is never explained why they are trying to open a portal to another dimension or they know of its existence (unless they watched the series via Netflix). The Russians simply exist because the writers thought it really-really cool to kill evil reds (the Nazis just weren't available)! All of the Russians are portrayed as sadists who take exceptional delight in drugging and beating up children (Evil Russian Colonel: Hahahaha... it's so good to be evil comrade now let's go drown some puppies for I am feeling very evil today!). There is even a Russian terminator whose only function is to be cruel and choke scientists in mid-air for failing \"to bring evil into the world\". We get it! The Russians are evil... The writers of this series are forever averse to explain why anything on the show works the way it does or how the Evil Russians discovered the portal in the first place. The adults in this series are also so dumb that only person who seems to notice a giant multi-legged spider walking around is a little girl (Look at the fireworks you little ingrate! Were celebrating America, freedom and Coca Cola here! Stop paying attention to obvious monsters!). When Jim Hopper calls the authorities and says that the said Evil Russians are on American soil nothing is done. I can even picture Ronald Reagan in the oval office telling his generals to stand down because a bunch of middle-schoolers are going to save America (who needs the Marines when you have Dustin singing Never Ending Story ugh!). The Mind Flayer, a disgusting creature made from something that crawled out of a sewer, created this magical goo to destroy Eleven for closing the interdimensional portal. Of all the plots the writers could've used was for instance using one of those weird kids who had powers to open a portal. That would have been cool to watch. They were kind of forgotten back in season two. But using \"Evil Russians\" is a bit of a clich\u00e9.", "reviewTitle": "Evil Russians?

Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: \"...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now \u2013 and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\"\n\nThe resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few.

Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. \n\nI have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. \n\nHaving seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. \n\nThere are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. \n\nBeyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on.

It doesn't have distinctive, stylish features. Into its 3rd season, The Blacklist survives, it thrives despite its being no Breaking Bad, or Mr. Robot, or Fargo, or The Knick. How is this possible? Just what is its appeal?\n\nJames Spader as Red Reddington is the answer and the sole reason this show is so watchable. He's not only the captain of the ship, he's the crew and the ship as well. In short, his performance is everything that makes this show great and I suspect he's somehow improved the template like performances of his supporting actors over time. The man is just a joy to watch and makes an improbable character--govt spy turned international criminal mastermind-- delightful and believable. Every actor on that show ought to thank Spader for allowing them the opportunity to make money on a show that would have been cancelled its first year--perhaps mid-season--if he were not on it. It's the darndest thing, the difference one actor can make. \n\nStill, I wish that the creators had chosen a different actress to play the part of Elizabeth Keen, the FBI profiler that Red Reddington is inexplicably fond of. Someone like Zoe Saldana would have been brilliant casting and added dimension to the mystery of the Keen-Reddington relationship. And perhaps better casting for that part would have inspired the writers to shape her role more credibly and sent the show into the stratosphere. While Megyn Kelly may be a solid actress, she does not yet have the chops to make something of the oddly inconsistent writing for her role. Too late to change this up now. \n\nI'm hardly the only fan who tunes in to enjoy Spader's performance, marveling at how the dreamy young actor with long blonde hair evolved into this very charming, balding older man who can act his *beep* off.

I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.\n\nSaying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound clich\u00e9 enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \"funny\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.\n\nAs for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.\n\nThis is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \"characters\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually. I'm utterly convinced the writers of this series does not have a creative bone in their bodies.\n\nI cannot wait for the day this series gets cancelled cause good riddance and hopefully I can enjoy AJ Cook in something again.", "reviewTitle": "Epitomizes everything I hate about crime procedurals", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2013-08-11", "titleId": "/title/tt0452046/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "rillau", "userId": "/user/ur84919407/"}, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4804961634927697, "id": "/title/tt0452046/userreviews/rw4046885", "interestingVotes": {"down": 4, "up": 11}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Hotchner is the legal mind, and the one to keep everything together.

I started only watching it couple of months ago, and I can't believe that it took me so long to discover it. This is the show where each episode reminds me of my favorite book on the subject of finding the serial killers by trying to get inside their minds and to think the way they do, and equally terrific adaptation, Red Dragon by Thomas Harris/Manhunter by Michael Mann. Again and again the team of the brilliant profilers, fly from their headquarters in Quantico, VA to different locations all over the country to put their minds together and complete the profile of the mysterious unsub (unknown subject) and to prevent the next strike which would be deadly. This is a very difficult, demanding and exhausting job where the lives of innocent people are at stake and every minute, even second matters. This job takes its toll from every member of the team. Often they have to make very difficult choices and more than once they face the deadly danger not only to themselves but to those who are the closest to them. \n\nSince I started watching the show, I am trying to catch up the seasons that I missed, so I watch the re-runs every time I have a chance getting the \"crash course\" of Criminal Minds. What amazes me that watching so many episodes in such short period of time only makes me wanting to see more. I don't recall a single mediocre episode. All of them share the intelligent writing, compelling story, inspired acting from the regular members of the cast (an elite team of FBI profilers - BAU analysts) and the guest stars. I like the music score and the choice of songs is very fitting for each occasion. I also like the famous quotes which one of the team members tells in the end of each episode, which sums up the story perfectly. More than once, I was moved deeply by the way the story was going and its resolution. What keeps me entrancing to the screen during each episode is the brain storm, the collective mind of the team putting the evidence, the small details together, analyzing them, searching for the right question to ask their super computer analyst Penelope Garcia; so she would perform her magic and come up with the one name - of the unsub who must be stopped before he attacks deadly again.\n\nI also noticed how masterfully the creators make the references not only to the real life famous cases but to the earlier films and books. I recognized the references to Tom Harris's Dr. Hannibal's books (the horrifying parts of \"Hannibal\" made one of the darkest and devastating two-hours episode) and films, to \"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\", to \"Natural Born Killers\". One memorable episode paid homage to both \"Psycho\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\". Often, the writers find the subjects for the episodes from the latest news.

The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie & Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.", "reviewTitle": "Entertaining. 94 version?

As the movie opens, Jo is offering a short story to a New York publisher, who to her delight offers to buy it, albeit with serious edits. Meanwhile Amy is in Paris with her aunt, where she runs into her friend Laurie. Back to Jo, who gets a letter that her younger sister Beth is very ill, so Jo returns home. We then go to \"Seven Years Earlier, Concord, Massachusetts\"... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest adaptation of the famed 1868 novel by Louise May Alcott. However, it is the first directed by a woman, namely Greta Gerwig. Following her strong 2017 directing debut \"Lady Bird\", Gerwig returns as director (and script writer). Gerwig confirms that she is a director to reckon with, as the movie is as pleasant as it is timely and contemporary (among others, examining the role of women and marriage). Saoirse Ronan, also the lead in \"Lady Bird\", is the central figure as (as Jo), and the main glue that holds together the large ensemble cast. The other sisters are played by Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, and Eliza Scanlan. Laura Dern is delightful as the gruels' mom. Timoth\u00e9e Chamelet, typically so solid, looks lost most of the time as his character tries to decide which of the sisters he really likes best. Meryl Streep gets about 10 min. of screen time as the crabby Aunt March. Last but not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score courtesy of Oscar-winnning composer Alexandre Desplat, and I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he gets another Oscar nomination for this.\n\n\"Little Women\" opened wide on Christmas Day and has done very well, both critically (it's currently rated 95% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and at the box office against formidable competition (the latest Star Wars). I saw it this past weekend and the Saturday early evening screening was PACKED (just short of a sellout). If you are in the mood for another take on \"Little Women\", or simply are a fan of Greta Gerwig or Saoirse Ronan, I readily suggest you check this out, be in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.", "reviewTitle": "Enjoyable ensemble cast performances", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-07", "titleId": "/title/tt3281548/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Jared_Andrews", "userId": "/user/ur53660798/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6835774235390218, "id": "/title/tt3281548/userreviews/rw5372434", "interestingVotes": {"down": 14, "up": 54}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "\"Little Women\" is the classic story of the four March sisters growing and learning about the world together in the northeastern United States during the 19th century. We have Jo (Saoirse Ronan) - the strong-willed writer, Meg (Emma Watson) - the softer, more traditional sister, Beth (Eliza Scanlen) - the quiet one, and Amy (Florence Pugh) - the spirited and most immature. Marmie, the mother, (Laura Dern) oversees the girls while the father is at war.\n\nThey're a charming bunch, different in their own way. The headstrong Jo believes she has this whole life thing figured out, and she often urges her sisters to follow her suggestions, which are an ounce of urgency away from becoming outright demands. Despite Jo's efforts, each girl possesses the gusto to follow her own path, and ultimately, they live the lives they want to lead as little women.\n\nGreta Gerwig delivers a wonderful adaptation of the classic novel, perhaps the best to date. Give her plenty of credit for the work, just make sure to also credit the actors. They're all brilliant. The girls give outstanding performances, as does Timothee Chalamet as Theodore Laurence, the boy next door to the girls. Everyone calls him Laurie, everyone except Jo.\n\nJo and Teddy, as she calls him, share an instant and lifelong connection. They love each other immediately and always. It's clear as day to everyone. The only person who doesn't seem to see it is Jo. Focusing on her writing and drive to show the world that women are worth more than their appearance, Jo has no interest in marriage or love. But this is a story, so the two will have their chance.\n\nHere comes the SPOILER.\n\nI'm sorry to question the writer of such a wonderful story, but with the clear love between Teddy and Jo, why in the world do they not end up together? The movie's version of the story attempts to explain it but fails miserably. In every scene Teddy and Jo share, the two characters display magnetic chemistry - the rare kind. Nothing can keep them apart. Except for an unfathomable choice by the author of the novel. Jo turns down Teddy, who turns to Amy for her hand in marriage. She says yes. This works well for Amy because she had always loved Laurie, as she calls him. But Jo is later so upset and desperately lonely that she immediately agrees to date a professor she met while teaching young writing students. The two get along fine. Just fine. The two get together after he shows up at the March home one day, spends a bit of time with the family, then leaves. As soon as he walks out the door, the rest of the family shouts at Jo that she loves him and should chase him. What? It's laughably absurd, as there is zero indication that Jo actually loves him. I hate to say this because I liked the movie very much, but this misstep in the story must be called out. Jo and Teddy should be together. Yes it's predictable, but it's the correct ending.\n\nEND of SPOILER\n\nGerwig makes a beautiful film, sagely including enough light moments to complement the heavy theme material that makes up more of the movie than younger viewers might notice. Gerwig establishes a fitting tone, lighting and style, all elevating the overall film. With all that she does well, she also makes one curious decision, which is to sequence the film completely out of chronological order. It never totally works, more often taking away from the story than improving it. The choice is one of the couple tiny blemishes preventing the film from being flawless.\n\nFor anyone and everyone, \"Little Women\" is worth seeing. See it with others and talk about it afterwards.

Its really nice to see Ronan on the edge to become truly her generations Meryl Streep. Oh Streep herself was fine in this, giving us quirky Aunt March in a very enjoyable, almost self ironic performance. Loved her characters unintentional sarcasm. Emma Watson is the weakest link, but her character is also the most uninteresting one. However its still sad she didn't do anything to uplift that fact. Florence Pugh is wonderful and totally deserving of her Oscar nomination for her loud, wild and then very calm and sensitive performance. So many emotions in one performance. Just great. Laura Dern is fine, lovely and giving a very warm performance. Chris Cooper is somehow wasted however it is always a good addition in any movie he is. Eliza Scanlan was great, already loved heir in \"Sharp Objects\" but she did something that Watson wasnt able. Bringing a rather blunt character truly to live. Last but certainly not least there was Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet who gives one of the most underrated performances of the year. How does he not get more mentions for this truly fantastic and fresh performance? And no I am not only talking about *his* scene I am talking about his entire appearance . So natural, so witty, so funny, so charming so tragic so wonderful. Did not expect him to live up to those little women but he did and deserves much more applause for it. The screenplay was great.

The lack of unnecessary dialogue, especially in the romantic scenes have been a more befitting choice, especially between Laurie and Amy where we see a skip in the dialogue, replaced by silence. Joe's \"I tried and I failed\" gives a good explanation, a good add-on to her reasons for her decision and a good complication to her later changing her mind. Her disappointment upon hearing the news is fantastic. This is More believable and tangible. I'm comparing it to the unnatural joy of Joe in The previous Version. Comedy well incorporated and funny. A little slogan in the end about domestic struggles. Good point, but Decreases the naturalness of the scene.

She unflinchingly remains true to herself, her family and her work as both a writer and a teacher.\n\nThe main difference between this adaptation and its predecessors is the stream of consciousness approach as the story moves between the present day March family, and the stories of growing up together. Parallels between the challenges when they were children and the struggles of adulthood weave together to tell their story both now and then. Gerwig and her team does a masterful job of storytelling to balance it all in a cohesive manner that holds the audience's attention and intrigue, even if most viewers already know the original story.\n\nTo enhance the superb storytelling, the film's cinematography and costume design, recreating 19th century New England, was a bright spot in this visually captivating film.

When she came out with Lady Bird in 2017, I absolutely loved it. So much so, that it was my favorite film of the year. Saoirse Ronan is such a talented actress and top three going today for me. So what happens when you add Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, and Laura Dern? You get a highly entertaining film based on a literary classic. A great final film of 2019.\n\nThe film is based on the book by Louisa May Alcott and is about a group of sisters who grow up together through years and learn lessons about life, love, death, womanhood, and the bond that keeps them united through the years. Jo March (played by Saoirse Ronan) also looks to find success in her writing and attempts to get her memoirs published. Most importantly, the film stars young charmer Timothee Chalamet.\n\nI read a lot of people had problems with the time jumping. I had no such issue. I think it was easy to tell when the film was going back and forth by the contrast of the picture (the memories were brighter and more yellowy orange) while the present was more blue. You can also tell from the hairstyles, especially that of Florence Pugh. I liked the narrative style that was implement by Gerwig, the story which has been adapted many times needed to be fresh for this modern audience.\n\nThe performances all around are great. There are humorous elements to most of the characters, especially that of Ms. Pugh. Ronan is fabulous as she pretty much always is and the script does not let the characters down. Its sharp and witty and has the right amount of emotional weight that it needs to. There are somber moments here as the sisters deal with a close death and the range of emotions is handled well by the actors and by Gerwigs direction.\n\nThe costume design, cinematography, and set design all feel incredibly authentic. Its a period piece and it feels like it comes out of the era. I don't know how closely the film follows the book but I'd suspect from the positive reviews there hasn't been too many big differences. The film handles its wintry elements well in addition, you can see why this was a holiday release.\n\nYou would think that Greta Gerwig has been making films for years and years from the way this film looks and feels. Its crazy to think this is her second work and that she just burst out behind the camera two years ago. Its a warm, expertly crafted film that keeps it light hearted while dealing with a lot of struggles and tribulations people go through in their lives. An excellent way to close out the year.

So much intelligence, so much kindness, so much sadness: so much to love and wonder. And it does all of it without being a \"romantic\" movie. It it is aware of the realities of women during this time period and treats marital situations with honesty, but also with grace. There is romance, but it is merely a part for these characters which I think is Gerwig's biggest accomplishment; to draw these women as more without the need to make them gritty, troubled, or with hubris.

The answer is probably no but after having sat through Greta Gerwig's lovingly shot and beautifully staged version of the beloved story of the March sisters, you'd be hard pressed too find many viewers that weren't glad this new take on the classic story came to life.\n\nAnnouncing herself as a filmmaking force with her directional debut Lady Bird, Gerwig proves here to be the real deal in a very big way, as she takes the reigns behind the camera and takes charged of screenwriting duties as she instills her own flavor and verve into Alcott's family drama.\n\nWhilst set in the Civil War era of the United States, Gerwig manages to bring modern day sensibilities and flair to the March's tale, without ever losing sight of the core heart and soul of the narrative that has managed to maintain a place in popular culture for these many years since it's initial release in print form.\n\nLittle Women is one of those features that feels accomplished and thought through wherever you look from Yorick Le Saux's photogenic cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's sumptuous costume design, through to a typically strong Alexandre Desplat score, as the film showcases Gerwig growing before our eyes as a director in what's a major step up production wise from the small-scale and more independently structured Lady Bird.\n\nAs with her breakout film, Gerwig has managed to assemble a fantastic and on song cast to bring her vision to screen with every performer bringing their A-game's to proceedings here, as returning Gerwig actors Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet as the determined and unflappable Jo March and the devilishly charismatic Theodore Laurence respectively shine brightest in a loaded ensemble.\n\nWith Lady Bird and this higher profile effort under her belt, it's clear that Gerwig is an actors director, as she also oversees the further establishment of 2019 breakout star Florence Pugh, who delivers an awards worthy turn as the more artistic and whimsical March sister Amy.\n\nThanks to the film's overwhelmingly strong performances and technical strengths, the fact that Little Women's now more formulaic and familiar plot movements and processions never threaten to detour from the fact this heartfelt and soulful effort is a thoroughly enjoyable and likable affair, that manages to say some important things about equality and female empowerment without ever feeling preachy or overbearing.\n\nA strong vision from a female filmmaker of substantial and timely power.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nA deservingly praised incarnation of a much adapted tale, Little Women is a fabulously watchable version of a literary classic that further enhances Gerwig and her actresses standings in the cinematic landscape.\n\n4 1/2 burnt novels out of 5", "reviewTitle": "A lovable adaptation of the beloved source material", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-14", "titleId": "/title/tt3281548/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "clare_fontaine", "userId": "/user/ur111829467/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6546433005033087, "id": "/title/tt3281548/userreviews/rw5371451", "interestingVotes": {"down": 19, "up": 60}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I will definitely introduce it to my mom and my girls.

This movie isn't new or its content original by any means (this is the seventh film adaptation after all). However, Gerwig has managed to give it a poignancy and relevance to today's issues while still maintaining an apparent loyalty to the period. It probably helped that Gerwig had tons of acting talent along for this film, including collaborators from her last film: Saoirse Ronan and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. In the end, I found this to be perhaps my most favorite adaptation of this classic piece of literature.\n\nWhere Gerwig shines in this film is her ability to use flashbacks and dueling timelines to show the contrast and growth of the characters in stark moments of brilliance. My one qualm is that this technique was perhaps used a little too liberally, which meant I lost track of which timeline was which a few times. Otherwise, the moments that paralleled the lives of these four girls from Massachusetts were played to maximum effect and done with cinematic artistry that should make this version the standard.\n\nI also appreciated the slight meta nature of the framing of the story, the superb classical music, and the beautiful set design. Still, it all pales in comparison to the actors. Aside from the ones already mentioned, there were standout performances by Florence Pugh (my favorite), Laura Dern, Emma Watson, Chris Cooper, and Meryl Streep (doing what Meryl Streep does). The best moments are the soliloquies about how successful writing isn't necessarily good writing, the economics of marriage, and the struggle to be an independent woman when it's also necessary to be wanted and loved by someone else.\n\nGreta Gerwig proving she's a master director, I give Little Women 4.5 stars out of 5.", "reviewTitle": "Greta Gerwig proving she's a master director.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-25", "titleId": "/title/tt3281548/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "troyano_ag", "userId": "/user/ur104985912/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6545160001358987, "id": "/title/tt3281548/userreviews/rw5431213", "interestingVotes": {"down": 5, "up": 24}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I honestly don't know what to say about this masterpiece.

However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.\n\nWe'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.\n\nMatt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:\n\nAlthough some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.\n\nJennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: \n\nRachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.\n\nCourtney Cox/Monica Gellar:\n\nIt's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.\n\nLisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: \n\nNow, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.\n\nDavid Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:\n\nIt's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.\n\nMatthew Perry/Chandler Bing:\n\nThey should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nSo, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.

It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you \"settle down\" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.\n\nIt follows the life of six young people living in New York City from 1994 to 2004, so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale, but the relationship truths never will be. Ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking. Ross' sister Monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school. Rachel has been Monica's friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddy's credit card when the series begins, and is looking for a career in fashion. Chandler, Ross' friend since college, is successful in his budding career in business. Rounding out the group is Joey, not the brightest bulb in the room, who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a TV show. Finally there is Phoebe. Her history with the group doesn't go much past the beginning of the series as she's had a rather Bohemian upbringing that has led to a Bohemian adulthood. Complicating factor as the series begins - Ross' wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman, Ross now and always has had a crush on Rachel who doesn't know he's alive, and Ross' wife discovers she is pregnant by Ross shortly after the separation.\n\nOne of the best shows on TV with the most heart and the most laughs.

Each character, except unfortunately for Monica, has grown positively in their own way.\n\nOn a sidenote, I really do hope that the \"anchor\" quality Monica's character used to have can come back a bit in season 7.

The first film was about stealing DVD players, and now we have a bad guy who is enhanced by technology, a kind of Robocop/Terminator with a little G.I Joe thrown in for good measure, and it just never lets up until the final one liner.\n\nEver since Hobbs and Shaw first faced off, they have swapped smack talk and body blows as they've tried to take each other down.\n\nWhen cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton gains control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever - and bests a brilliant and fearless rogue MI6 agent, who just happens to be Shaw's sister - these two enemies must partner up to bring down their seemingly invincible foe.\n\nIf you were a fan of the buddy-cop sub genre that was rife in the eighties and nineties, then this has nostalgia written all over it. It resembles 1989's Tango and Cash more than any other film, as that film was purely tongue in cheek, never took itself seriously, and the stars were happy to send themselves up to get a laugh and to enhance the nonsensical narrative.\n\nStatham and Johnson are clearly having lots of fun making this, and the first and final act are clearly the best parts of the film. When the pair are doing their separate things, it falters in the second act, which is a shame, because Elba's 'bad guy' is a true cinematic villain, full of speeches, protuberance, and envy, all the makings of a brilliant antagonist.\n\nAdd a couple of wonderful cameos, and Hobbs and Shaw is a fun action film that throws everything at the screen, hoping that something will stick, and most of it does.\n\nIt's a shame that most of the tentpole set pieces were offloaded on the spolierific trailers, but that really doesn't matter, as the final confrontation is pretty visceral and inventive, and one wishes fro once that it maybe would have been enhanced by the medium of 3D.\n\nThe film references The Rock, Escape from New York, G.I.

If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.\n\nFlorence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.\n\nThe cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.\n\nAnd Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.\n\nThis film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of \"That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" I suggest that audiences take this advice.\n\nPSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory.

I recommend you watch \"The Wicker Man\" from 1973, Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"The Holy Mountain\" and Sergei Parajanov's \"The Color of Pomegranates\" before you watch this watered down, pretentious murk in order to get a sense of how movies can truly be mind-altering. The \"story\" is essentially every clich\u00e9 of the slasher genre mashed together: a group of young people naively go into the wilderness (Sweden, very scary place lol) and encounter messed up stuff. They each die one by one and, SPOILER ALERT, there is a \"final girl\" who survives in the end. The rest of this clich\u00e9 story is fluff. If you think, based on the trailer, that much of this film will mirror the original Wicker Man, you are exactly right. There is even a big fire at the end where a guy gets burned alive. There is a fine line between homage and rip-off and this may a great example of a film that slips over the edge into complete rip-off territory. I won't even go into all the logical loopholes in the story and the scenario, or point out that none of the customs line up at all with ancient Scandinavian rituals (thus making one wonder why this even takes place in Sweden to begin with, like, why couldn't this be a cult in upstate NY?) because there's no point. The script doesn't even attempt to be deep, the research here is sub-Wikepedia level, and the characters are cookie-cutter types you've seen before in a million other horror movies. One logical question I would ask, however, is how come all of these people are anthropology PhD students going to research Scandinavian paganism but none of them speak Swedish??!?!? Has the writer ever even talked to someone with a PhD??? All this said, Florence Pugh is a talented actress and does a great job with the shallow script. She transcends the material and shows that she can be a powerful dramatic actress. The cinematography is gorgeous too. The editing and sound are pitch perfect. I was especially taken by the set design, the use of furniture and quirky wall paintings to give the film a sense of intricate beauty to contrast with the horror. This is all really fabulous and the people who worked on these aspects of the film should be commended. It is all cosmetic, however. Without the mask of beautiful production and a gifted actress, the director/ writer Aster has absolutely nothing going on here. \"Hereditary\" was a very good, solid horror film and I wonder if Aster didn't rush into this sophomore effort too soon. This seems like a script he could have banged out in a night, especially since it feels like something made out of other films. It also seems that Aster repeats some of the same tricks from \"Hereditary\"- using shocking, Gaspar No\u00e9-like violence and relying on making his audience feel uncomfortable at the sight of incongruously naked people running around. These stock images are going to get old really fast for him, he needs to work on building up to scares that really pay off. There will be people who love this director, who are swept away by the cool style and photography of this film or who have simply never seen any of the hundreds of other movies out there with strange imagery and creepy paganism, and these people are going to think this movie is a mind-blower.

I wish I could give credit to the production designer but putting the tune for sacrifice on the sacrificial character's costume isn't clever, it's tacky. It's like having a name tag saying \"Hi, my name is Murderer\" in a slasher film. The lighting decision to have a horror film be in broad daylight is neither original (Wicker Man) nor well done (it is very straightforward camera angles other than a singular upside down windshield shot).\n\nThe breaching of multiple genres is a good thing and could be praised, if it was done in a way that complimented the strengths of the genres involved and conveyed the message. Neither of these happened. Instead, random lines of humor were included interspersed between gratuitously graphic on screen killings. Then there were completley purposeless orgy sequences with explicit nudity that I have read were included as comic relief according to the director. How is disgusting nudity of about 15 elderly women for a full minute on screen funny? Are you trying to shock us into laughter because we have no other way to respond to something so depraved? And if it wasn't meant for comedy (even though Aster publicly said it was) then what could have been the purpose when the same plot point could have been covered by them being clothed onlookers? The perversion and level of gratuitous filth in this movie were terrible, but the fact that they didn't even progress the story or theme was what was the most disturbing part. It wasn't even for something valuable to the production.\n\nLastly, this whole 'its really a break up movie' gimmick could have been okay, if you weren't asking us to side with the girl who murdered her partner of 3 and a half years instead of a cult member who has killed all of her friends. And what was the boyfriend's crime? Wanting out of a relationship that was toxic, but waiting to break up because the girls entire family just died? I get that he is a jerk about the thesis thing, but in terms of the relationship, he was beyond supportive. She was the one who cheated with the swedish friend first and who accused him of forgetting her birthday, which, he actually didn't do. So what exactly is Aster wanting us to enjoy about his take on the break up where the 'heroine' murdered the one person who didn't think he should break up with her right after she lost three family members?\n\nBeyond all of that, the movie was underwhelming in terms of scares or terror. It was neither a thriller nor a collection of jump scares or chase scenes. Now those have been done to death (pun intended) by the horror genre, but what was scary in this movie? The people killing themselves of their own volition? The off screen disappearances?\n\nI was disgusted by the depravity of this film and entirely disappointed in it's lack of any statement about the views or choices of the characters or situation.

There's also a lot of politics and scheming, kinda giving you early Game of Thrones vibes, and all of it was intriguing.\n\nAnd while that's great and all, we are also treated to some truly magnificent fight sequences where the animators flex like crazy.

I was 5 minutes in before I openly realized the characters were voiced in English and not Japanese! And really, really good voice acting! I know there have been good American animated shows and movies made, but to me, the last time I saw such great English voice acting paired with Japanese (style) animation was the Spawn animated series. I consider that series a classic and outsider... and now we may well have another!\n\nThere are obviously a number of quality pieces put into place to make this series - production, cast, writing. This is exactly the type of project a fan holds their breath and hopes, but does not have too high of expectations. Expectation shattered - this is high quality stuff! Very brutal content including horrific deaths of innocents, graphic violence, and no mercy shown... Hooray!!!\n\nThe villain, Dracula, is humanized immediately, which gives him cause and texture - not just a mindless slayer. The hero has a number of anti-hero qualities, which just makes him more interesting. Undoubtedly this series will unfold with a number of awesome battles and conversations that question morality, cause and purpose.\n\nThe content obviously will not be for everyone - wholesale slaughter of religions figures, women and children may prove to much for some, but for others? A true surprise and fun refreshing release.\n\nEnjoyed like a fine wine 9/10\n\nedit: finally got to the 2nd season, and while I won't change my score, the 2nd season is a disappointment. Everything is in place for success, production wise, but the content (by comparison to the first season) is restrained, common, Boring. the charm of the first season was how refreshing the content was, which included exciting, entertaining, sinister content. The first scene in season 2 attempts this, but does so in a completely anti-entertainment manner! All the fun of the first season is absolutely smashed right to begin with, then the viewer gets 2-4 episodes of dialog, with very little action, and when thing finally do get going? Not that interesting! What happened? It's like the main creative force behind the first season was intentionally fired, and someone more PC was hired to make a generic, boring (albeit well produced) sequel!

Make no mistake; this is animated fare strictly for adults. And that's perfectly fine.\n\nThe 2016 production of Berserk has sadly skimped on production values, leaving fans of the longtime manga series with a sour taste in their mouths. Castlevania, however, scratches much of that same itch. It's gratuitously violent, dark as pitch, and set in a medieval fantasy world. The writers go straight for the jugular and pull no punches, obviously inspired by Berserk and other series like it. It's refreshing considering that the original owners of the Castlevania IP, Konami, have taken an obvious downturn in the quality production of their various legendary properties recently in favor of instead developing pachinko and gambling machines and firing longtime creative leads such as Hideo Kojima. Fans of the series need not worry, plenty of the classic Castlevania feel is here, treated with proper reverence by the shows writers and directors.\n\nThe animation is very good, and the art in particular is superb. Animated features and series have been steadily improving since the dawn of the HD era, and Castlevania continue to represent them well. The English voice cast shines as well, with Armitage's performance standing out among the others. He does a fantastic job as Trevor Belmont.\n\nMy only complaint here is the brevity of the series. Four ~23 minute episodes is not that much content, and it makes me wonder whether Netflix wouldn't have been better served to put this \"season\" out as a feature-length prologue film instead in order to advertise a lengthier season 2. But all-in-all, it's worth the time, especially to those interested in the Castlevania series, but even to those unfamiliar with it and in search of a gritty, well-animated, well- acted piece of dark medieval fantasy.", "reviewTitle": "This is what Berserk (2016) should have been.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2017-07-08", "titleId": "/title/tt6517102/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "bosyeed", "userId": "/user/ur91941215/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.569911720215135, "id": "/title/tt6517102/userreviews/rw5536729", "interestingVotes": {"down": 3, "up": 13}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "MUUSST WATCH , Every episode is much better than the previous one all actions all twists and full of enjoyment you will never regret it and please leave good ratings so people watch it too", "reviewTitle": "Absolutly on of the best animes i watched", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-08", "titleId": "/title/tt6517102/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "benjaminhass-46806", "userId": "/user/ur70694503/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5584452278524498, "id": "/title/tt6517102/userreviews/rw4421058", "interestingVotes": {"down": 22, "up": 46}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I think the show is fantastic both first and second season, but I am disappointed in the way that there is simply too little, like the Warcraft movie, if you are gonna do it do whole heartedly, why not start at the beginning with Leon Belmont and how Dracula came to be, and workout a series of good seasons based on one of the best game storylines ever created?\n\nI'm done with season 2 and I just want more, and I really hope too see some lord of the shadows spin off down the line.

The quirky schtick was a bad gimmick that might have been funny if they only dropped it once and did not carry it on so long. I'll add in the sisters here too, every last one but Lenore was unbearably presumptuous and stupid. Carmilla was reduced to a whiner, Striga did literally nothing but state obvious crap as if it was genius and Morana did even less than that. Lenore was at least tolerable in that she appeared to have multiple facets in being a character. She enjoyed being cruel but realizes you capture more with honey. In other words she's at least believable in that you may get some \"walkies\" if you do what she wants and so you probably shouldn't stab her in the back as soon as you can. The rest of the characters have some seriously ambiguous and vague motivations that I won't spoil here but lets just say if you read someone as rubbing you the wrong way, your instincts are probably very correct. There's some real mustache twirling levels of cartoonish villainy in just being so predictably evil.\n\nThen we have Alucard and literally everything going on around him... Everything about him this season should have been scrapped and I'm not even harping on the bi sex scene at the end. I'm talking about how completely and totally useless everything that happened there was other than to give us a reminder that he still exists and trying badly to give a storyline to justify looking back to him every now and then. Taka and Sumi were terrible. All around they were completely grating. Their dialogue was trash, their motivations were nonsensical, their turnabout could be seen coming from the very first sparring match... Total garbage that did nothing but waste time. God don't let that be a setup for Alucard being the next big bad when Trevor and Sypha come back to question his yard decorations.\n\nNow after that mega pill to swallow, the high points. Despite some clear drops in quality the fight scenes remain clever and brutal. Sypha has got to be one of the most OP characters in the series by now. Ice magic shields used angel vivisection, she is a meatgrinder. Can't stress enough how much damage she can do. Trevor shows he's a capable man with just his hands several times over, he can and will fold people up like a lawn chair. Classy bringing the OG whip back alongside the vampire killer for a bit of fanservice. The music for the finale is absolutely up there with Bloody Tears in season 2. The final showdown definitely shows where the extra effort missing from the prior animation went, it is phenomenal with some dynamic camerawork and gruesome kills.\n\nIsaac is by far my favorite of this series, he chews the scenery, his dialogue is stellar, his story is the best. I would easily watch a season of nothing but Isaac and the Captain. He's the most compelling antagonist the series has set up so far.

What did I get? Video Games answer to Game of Thrones.\n\nI am not too heavily invested in the original Castlevania series. My first and really, only game that I played was \"Symphony of the Night\". Truly a work of art, a masterpiece but I didn't play the games prior and only saw the games after on YouTube walkthroughs. Though I learned a bit about the rather rich lore.\n\nWhen I heard this was being made, I didn't know what to make of it. There are way too many bad movies and TV shows based on video games (which is sadly nearly all of them) and some of them had NO RIGHT to be bad. Max Payne, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed immediately come to mind in that regard. Even the Final Fantasy movie, Spirits Within was rather lackluster and it was directed by the series creator and visionary, Hironobu Sakaguchi (Though I think there were production issues and \"too many chefs in the kitchen\" during that time)! I had just given up on VG to screen adaptations.\n\nThen after many friends told me to watch these few episodes, I was curious at most... but then it grabbed my attention when I heard that after the series premiered and got critical acclaim; a second season was confirmed and announced IMMEDIATELY after it was released. So I made time for it... and I am so sorry I didn't watch it earlier. It is nothing short of spectacular!\n\nIt opens up with a scene which was heavily inspired by Symphony of the Night (I won't dare spoil it) and it shows WHY Dracula is the world's enemy... and it's really friggin' heart breaking! Then we're introduced to Trevor Belmont in a way that is both epic and hilarious!\n\nI think that's where I should stop because I don't want to spoil even the slightest detail. The characters are great, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant! Kudos to Armitage, Reynoso, McTavish, Frewer and ESPECIALLY Callis! I did not expect that voice to come from James Callis, so low and rich and he's surprisingly intimidating when he wants to be.\n\nThe score is great too, but it's Trevor Morris. I've come to expect good work from him. Seriously, I don't get why he hasn't composed a score for something like a Marvel movie yet he really knows how to work the scenes.\n\nThe writing is outstanding. Warren Ellis is a very solid writer, his work on the 2011 X-Men animated series is truly something to admire. The animation is BEAUTIFUL! Absolutely stunning! Anime inspired styles done by a Western is something I do have a soft spot for, even the ones which are a bit \"standard\" !but this is just gorgeous-and where, WHERE did they find Sam Deats!? What an incredible debut! Apparently, this is the first thing he has ever worked on as a director... That is hard to believe. This is definitely a love project, you could FEEL the respect that was being put into this!\n\nIt goes to show that when creative freedom is given to the right people, you really can make artistic magic with ANYTHING! Right here is proof that video game to screen adaptations can work. It took nearly two score and twain, but they finally did it!\n\nKudos to Sam Deats and the entire cast and crew for this masterpiece! Also, expect a few Annies to go to this series.

Even though Vlad is known to despise humanity and slaughter people who bother him Lisa confidently goes to his door and introduces herself to him. Dracula becomes infatuated with her and they soon marry even though he is vampire. They have a son they name \"Alucard\" (Dracula spelled backwards). For twenty years they are happily married and Vlad travels abroad (Lisa's request) to better know mankind. However in the twentieth year religious fanatics from the Archbishop capture Lisa and declare her science \"witchcraft\"! She is publicly burned at the stake, crying out for Dracula to not take vengeance on them because they don't know what they are doing. As expected Dracula returns from his travels and is ENRAGED when he finds out what has happened. He goes to the city in a giant, red, fiery form in the sky and gives them exactly one year before he unleashes total HELL on them. Next we are introduced to Trevor Belmont. He is the last of his lineage from a famous family of vampire hunters who seems down and out of luck. Trevor's luck changes when he rescues the magic wielding Sypha Belnades from a dungeon where she had been petrified to stone by a cyclops. She then decides to stay at Trevor's side for the meantime since they presumably have the same interests. Together they slay various undead monsters and creatures of the night.

It is watchable but I'd say it is definitely a second tier show good to release in summer when nothing else is on. \n\nThe filming throughout the 10 episodes was dark, always very dark. It reminded me of The Killing but that at least was in part due to being in rainy Seattle. Just being dark for 10 episodes removed any effect it would have on certain story lines, scenes. \n\nA lot of the story just didn't make sense. Why would they have wanted to get a really upscale expensive office instead of just laying low? And on the other hand why would you make this choice for your family but not live more extravagantly? They said they'd been doing this for 10 years - if you weren't living large wouldn't you have more than 8 million in savings? And why would his partner skim if they were paid well after seeing what happened to the guy they replaced? \n\nJason Bateman's acting is just being himself. It was like he was on the set of Horrible Bosses. It bothered me. His relationship with Laura Linney was all over the place. They really didn't have good chemistry and their marriage, even in flashbacks, was pathetic and a downer. That she was so quick to jump at her husband getting involved with a cartel to clean their money seemed off. \n\nThe story could have been a lot better. They really did a disservice making half the characters seem like red neck inbreds. That know they aren't smart. In a town that is totally corrupt. What are the chances you'd end up in a town with all that drama.\n\nWe also had the typical had to interject Obama and the rednecks of course have the Don't Tread on Me flags. Pretty much silly west coast beliefs on how flyover country lives.\n\nThere weren't a lot of twists in the story that you would be reeling from. The dialogue was very basic. The characters were never really developed much. \n\nIt would have been much better if they had developed the characters more, had better dialogue, skipped all the marital strife that didn't add to the story and use some of the better characters more. The best under utilized character is the guy living in their house. \n\nIf you took out the swearing and maybe the strip club nudity this could be on NBC.

The series attracted my attention thanks to Netflix. I started watching the series without much anticipation. It was very immersive and fluent. The monologues were fine. It's nice to be told the events through Joe's eyes. I think that's what keeps the series going.\n\nThe series tells the story of an obsessed perverted man falling in love with a woman. When Joe first sees Beck in the bookstore, he falls in love. We are going to see Joe's interaction with Beck, which starts with a book offering, and turns into a relationship. Joe proceeds to stalk Beck on every available social media site, quickly determining that she's the one for him. In the process, Joe is doing some amazing things. He's watching Beck's house, following every step. He goes into her house and steals her stuff, her clothes and her phone. He kills her lover, researching her friends. In doing so, he remains so calm that everything he does looks normal to the viewer. You realize you're wrong, but you don't hate Joe. Joe's problem is actually his background. His past experiences make him obsessed. Both Joe and Beck are two problematic people. \"How is the relationship between two problematic people?\" We find the answer to this question. Although it isn't true, Joe is doing everything for the woman he loves, Beck doing it for herself. You decide who's worse. Despite the bloody appearance, the series is not horrifying.\n\nI found acting performances in the series successful. The soundtracks of the series was good. Colors, sounds, frames - everything works correctly on the atmosphere. Although it is simple as subject, its immersiveness increases the traceability. If you don't watch with too much expectation, I think you'll have a good time.\n\nThe series has a lot to say about our society's addiction to social media, and the dissonance between the curated images we project of ourselves online and our authentic selves. While You offers some suspense, it also offers a distorted way of looking at Joe's criminal behavior.

He's a \"niceguy\" who would be \"so perfect\" for the woman he desires if only she would \"see how good he is for her\". The object of he obsession, Beck, is a cute, flirtatious burgeoning writer who he idolizes in the most bizarre way and pushes to be her best, truest, most writer-est self.

Also there is no way this could earn 8 stars, so please people, make your marketing a bit less obvious. The female character is the worst. She's a self involved millenial and a wannabe poet with absolutely nothing intruguing about her. You'll find more interesting characters in Vampire Diaries. Also the acting is horrible, it's almost hard to watch. The male character is supposed to be a Dexter, but like somebody else already stated, he has no charisma fot that. They bond over mocking other people about how stupid they are and what stupid books they read. Excuse me, are they supposed to be adults or snobbish teenagers? Oh, right, they are supposed to be intellectuals. Unfortunately there's nothing to back it up. Or maybe the writers want us to believe they are intellectuals simply because we saw them physically present in a book shop.\n\nAbout the inner dialoque of the guy. Please someone enlighten me if they wanted to show us that he is smart like Sherlock or that he is narcissistic and delusional. He is supposed to be super observant and know everything about the girl by simply looking at her when they first meet. Ok, Sherlock did it and we knew how he drew conlusions. It was smart. It was believable. Here it's plain silly. Like he knows that she used a credit card to let him know her name, because obviously she had enought cash on her to buy a book. He couldn't know that so unless they wanted to show us his narcissism, it doesn't make sense. Also he says to himself that \"she reached for the book herself so that he could notice she's not wearing a bra\"? What the hell? How do you make it more noticeble when you reach for a book? And again, he couldn't know it anyway.\n\nWhat almost made me laugh was the window. How comfortable. The guy is stalking her, so she lives on a first floor and has huuuuge windows with no courtains, and happen to do literally everything in front of those windows (like fighting with boyfriend, having sex, masturbating) with the lights on for everyone passing by outside to be able to see everything.

'YOU' is a brand new psychological thriller based on the novel with the same name written by Caroline Kepnes. Meet 'Lonely Boy' Joe Goldberg an ordinary New York book store manager who quickly falls in love with customer Guinevere Beck a wannabe writer.\n\nThis works perfectly due to his knowledge of the literacy world and even helps him flirt more effectively with Beck as time goes on. From the get go he is obsessive, he want's Beck in his life, slowly making his way through her social media pages building up an immense knowledge of her profile. Kind of like 'Criminal Minds' but not for anything good. It turns out Beck has another man in the picture, a man that only seems to use her for sex, Joe finds this out and tries to give her the respect she so definitely wants but she doesn't budge. Until, Joe kidnaps her eh, bed partner Benji and when Beck tries to get in touch with him Joe has his phone controlling the narrative.\n\nThen there's Peach who is also obsessed with Beck and totally in love with her, so when Joe comes along, this guy who will do anything for Beck makes Peach decide this guy is a threat to their future together so does everything in her power to destroy Joe and Becks connection even going to the extremes of trying to guilt trip Beck into staying in Paris with her. Overall the show is very well written, it begins as a slow burn and gets more and more exciting as it goes on. Penn Badgley and Elizabeth Lail both take turns at narrating this series and Lail also takes her turn at being the stalker which is a nice wee turnaround fitting with the overall narrative, it's as if Joe has subconsciously rubbed off on Beck making her unknowingly take on those creepy traits (For example Joe gets a new girlfriend and Beck keeps turning up infront of them) In a show filled with murder, lies and stalking where none of the characters are actually good 'YOU' is a show that hooks you wanting more. Luckily it's been renewed for a second season so we get to see more of what Joe will get up to and after that rollercoaster season finale the audience deserves much more to get their teeth into.

Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of \"The Shining\" (1980) a cinematic sequel. Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. \"The Shining\" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off. Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from.

For the most part, and with the help of Ewan McGregor who plays an alcoholic, grown-up version of The Shining's Danny Torrence, they pull it off.\n\nWhile Doctor Sleep is a rather drawn-out and, mostly, slowish-moving film, it still has enough to it, to not lose one's attention. The story-line is solid and engaging, although those unfamiliar with the book and looking for outright horror and gore, will find little satisfaction. There are a couple of scenes which can be construed as \"horrific\", but in my opinion, Doctor Sleep is not really a \"horror flick\" by definition. To me, it is more like an intense drama about good vs evil, with a couple of well-done 'end-of-life' scenes thrown in. :)\n\nWhat I most enjoyed about it, is that in this day and age where practically every story ever has already been made into a movie, this one's plot was just a bit off the beaten path and came across as slightly new and original in its approach, while still pretty seamlessly tying it in to the well-known classic: The Shining.\n\nIf I had to add one con, it would be a somewhat minor one, in that, at times, the girl who plays Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who also possesses 'the shining', and who can communicate with Danny, delivers her lines in almost a stone-like manner, and at other times as if she is rapidly reading. It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.\n\nWhile good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle.

That wasn't so bad actually! Now, hear me out. When I first saw the previews for this I felt disappointed by the visual look of the film, as it was all too green-tinted and lacked the Kubrick-esque framing I want from a film like this (it being a sequel to \"The Shining\" after all). Remember, I care too much about the visual aesthetics of these things sometimes. Especially when it was clearly supposed to connect right to the iconic classic. The green tint stays throughout the film, much to my displeasure. Worked great in \"Joker\" though. But once I got what the story was and paid attention I realized I was getting invested. This is a different type of film while still remembering to pay huge amounts of respect to the legacy of the original. Once you do get to the elements that carry over from Kubrick's film it felt well earned. Interestingly enough they kind of blend well together too eventually. We delve into the supernatural aspects of what Stephen King was going after in his book, and that's completely fine. I don't mind a chilling spookie once in a while. Recently I've felt done with most of the modern day horror film tropes, so it's such a shock for me to say that I had a good time with \"Doctor Sleep\".\n\nThe progression of where Danny Torrance's character goes to is a natural right step. They go for the 'father like son' kind of thing, and I was completely onboard with it. The ghost of Jack Nicholson's presence looms strongly over the story too, with Danny fearing not to follow his father's footsteps. The new story elements were able to grab my attention as well. Again, as soon as it clicked what type of plot/movie this was, then it worked. It's its own thing, and that's great. No \"Shining\" remake - except for some re-created imagery (handled with nice respect) - But most importantly: The story and characters moved forwards. Loved what they did with the character Rose the Hat. What a sinister yet oddly charming antagonist portrayed hypnotically by Rebecca Ferguson. Hope she gets the deserved credit. Ewan McGregor will always be Obi-Wan to me, but he was a fantastic choice to play Danny. He can convincingly make me believe that he's got the 'shine'. It surprises me how positive I feel about the movie! It's a neat little companion piece to the classic. Again, big props for them to go for their own thing. This is no \"Force Awakens\", if you know what I mean. You'll walk though memory lane here for sure. The difference is that it doesn't rely on the nostalgia to tell their story.

The film's impeccable attention to detail has also ensured that it is still studied and well-respected today. As a huge fan of the Kubrick film as well as Ewan McGregor, I was really excited for \"Doctor Sleep,\" but unfortunately, I found it to be a huge letdown.\n\nThe plot of this sequel centers around an adult Danny Torrance (McGregor,) working in a clinic in New England while also trying to deal with a severe drinking problem. He must work to defeat an evil cult called the True Knot, led by \"Rose the Hat,\" after a 12-year-old girl who also has the powers of \"the shining\" gets in its crosshairs. I was never expecting this film to top the genius of Kubrick, but Mike Flanagan seems like a talented director who wanted to really honor the source material, so I was hoping for it to at least try to be meaningful.\n\nThe first major problem with the film is its tedium. While the pace of \"The Shining\" was slow, it was slow in a great way, as in \"slow-burn to build up maximum suspense and dramatic tension.\" On the other hand, \"Doctor Sleep\" just feels tedious. Large stretches of the film pass by with virtually no keyp lot or character development not explored in other scenes, and the film feels repetitive and like it's going nowhere after a while until we get close to the climax. The film also lacks the genuine suspense and tension of the original, since this tediousness impedes on any sense of impending dread. I also feel that the more sprawling narrative of this story as opposed to \"The Shining\" may have been somewhat detrimental to its sense of tension. It also lacks the psychological fear of \"The Shining.\" Even though the True Knot and its followers are creepy, attempts to build up a real sense of terror around them generally fall flat. Ewan McGregor tried his best, but his performance is unfortunately rather bland and very limited in range.

Every single horror element is fully explained, every mystery is revealed, every (simple) analogy is spelled out for you. Nothing is left to the imagination.

To both adapt a Stephen King novel, which is no easy achievement considering his uniquely descriptive writing style, and provide a sequel to what many describe as \"the greatest horror film of all-time\". Quenching the thirst of King's avid readers and cinephiles alike. So even without divulging my own opinion on Doctor Sleep, applause must be given for just producing this feature. That, unfortunately for Flanagan, doesn't result in myself excusing specific inexcusable filmmaking tendencies that taint, not just Doctor Sleep, but various decaying intellectual properties that have been unnecessarily drudged up again.\n\nAn alcoholic scarred Dan Torrance, having endured the irrevocable dangers of the Overlook Hotel ('The Shining'), has his peace shattered when he encounters a young extrasensory girl whom is being hunted down by shine-draining monsters.\n\nFirst and foremost, I have not read the novel, although this should not come as a surprise. I have however, watched 'The Shining' multiple times. Now, what promotes the aforementioned horror as the best of its kind, is legendary Stanley Kubrick using the essence of King's novel and essentially making his own iteration of it. One that the renowned supernatural writer still, to this day, has mixed emotions for. So for Flanagan to introduce some faithful interpretations of Doctor Sleep, whilst maintaining the cinematic endeavour that Kubrick meticulously crafted, is as I said, unfathomable. And there's a perfectly valid reason for that. The overtly supernatural strands of the novels do not complement the genesis of terror from Kubrick's film. Which is why, with great regret, I have to report that Doctor Sleep does not work. It doesn't.\n\nA beastly behemoth that, whilst does stand on its own two legs, relies on heavy-handed storytelling techniques and nostalgia to tackle both mediums that inspired it. In tonality, they are irrefutably different from each other. But before the disappointing third act is tackled, let's address some positives first.\n\nDoctor Sleep is a shining example of depicting childhood trauma and how fragmented coping mechanisms are embedded throughout adulthood. Young Danny imaginatively designs mental traps so that he can hold the starving ghosts from the Overlook in captivity. Yet that wilful mentality does not prevent him from suffering with alcoholism, substance abuse and an insalubrious lifestyle that masquerades the trauma instead of curing it. Thematically, this is powerful, and grants the narrative a solid cohesion throughout. For the first two hours, you subconsciously warm to Danny due to the tormenting fears he has established throughout the two films. He's a pillar of \"the shining\". McGregor consistently captivated by depicting a fragile mentality through a physically demanding performance, maintaining the entranced demeanour of his younger character.\n\nThe first hour, that heavily explained \"the shining\" and the intentions of the merciless antagonists The True Knot, experienced inconsistent tones due to the mass sprawl of locational change. One minute we're in a sleepy town, the next a woodland area, and then all of a sudden eight years have been and gone. The zippy nature of the editing and bloated exposition resulted in atmospheric terror being abolished. The tension was non-existent, and the imitation of Kubrick's directing style paled in comparison.\n\nThen, the second hour commenced, which is by far one of the strongest acts the year has yet to offer. Flanagan retained a surprisingly dark tone that, was so shocking, forced audience members to leave the auditorium. The mind-space of Abra, a precocious teenager who has \"shine\", produced a transcendental imaginative battle against Rose the Hat, leader of The True Knot. Ferguson, who portrayed the primary antagonist, was sensational. Equalling the likes of Pennywise as one of the most enthralling King villains ever depicted. Sinister, unrelenting and bordering on near-lunacy. Controlling every scene from just her eyes alone, she enhanced the palpable tension. She made the second act. In fact, she made the film. The interjecting gore and darkness throughout the middling act abruptly astonished me, and settled for a direction that I thought would control the underwhelming first act.\n\nThe third act then arrives, and the entire story crumbles much like the Overlook itself. Plagued by an overshadowing sickness that 'The Shining' had produced. Nostalgia. Remember that time where Jack viciously chopped the bedroom door down with an axe? Or that moment where blood came hurtling through the hallways in slow motion? What about Room 237? The introductory swooping camera movement that Kubrick embraced whilst the Torrance's drove to the hotel? The typewriter? Slowly walking up the stairs in a confrontational manner? The snow-covered hedge maze? The twins? No? You don't remember? Flanagan has got you covered. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, yet it must be handled with delicacy. The difference between imitating and homaging is very fine, and unfortunately Flanagan settled for the former.\n\nSo much of 'The Shining' is replicated in the third act, scene for scene, that it was a near-identical copy without the textual substance that accompanied them originally. The re-casting of the original actors, despite Essoe bettering Duvall's performance (although not difficult), felt unnecessary. Almost tarnishing 'The Shining' in itself. Danny walking through the dilapidated hallways for ten minutes whilst Flanagan incorporates identical sequences, had no purpose other than to forcefully remind you that this is the sequel. Literarily, it never progresses Danny's character or the plot. Rose the Hat staring at the blood-spewing elevators? Pointless. Danny staring at an axe encased in glass? A suitable nod to its predecessor. Do you see the difference? Between imitation and homage? The third act was littered with falsified copies, preying on the nostalgia of fans. It's uninspired. It's mundane. And it made me a dull boy.\n\nCreatively, Doctor Sleep managed to infuse the very best of its adapted novel and preceding feature, but embellished the very worst techniques when conveying the plot. Psychologically stimulating without installing dread. Extrasensory without testing the senses.

Seeing the trailer for Doctor Sleep and discovering Ewan McGregor was playing an adult Danny Torrance, I thought the concept might be interesting.\n\nEveryone acts fantastic in this film. I thought Ewan McGregor built a very nice character. If I had imagined how Danny might have turned out after the first film ended, I don't think I would have predicted it much different. There are a few intense moments with the villains (Primarily Rose the Hat and Snakebite Andi) that made me absolutely hate them (which is a good thing). I think the things they do in the film would make anyone want them to see a terrible fate.\n\nI found myself smiling at the call-backs to the classic movie, and when Danny returns to the Overlook Hotel. It's been a while since I've said to myself \"Oh wow, there it is\" that many times at a film. I will say there are a couple scenes at the Overlook that feel like they were written in to make the fan base happy rather than be part of the story, but nothing that drags on too long.\n\nAs far as it being a scary film, you may jump a few times, and some scenes are a little disturbing, but by Stephen King standards, it's more of a suspense film.\n\nAn advantage I'll give this film over The Shining is that even though the film is two and a half hours, it doesn't get boring. Not that The Shining was boring, but it is a very slow film. Stanley Kubrick loved to throw in very long shots in his films, and while I personally think they worked sometimes, other times they were excessive, and in The Shining, they were excessive to me.\n\nI think this film is at least worth a watch whether you're a fan of the Kubrick film or not, because it's sort of it's own film in a way.

Despite the authors widely recognised disappointment with Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, the film has stood the test of time as one of horror cinema's greatest achievements. In 2013, King released a follow-up novel, Doctor Sleep, which provides the basis for Flanagan's latest King adaptation (his second following 2017's Gerald's Game) starring McGregor as a middle-aged Danny Torrance, still haunted by the traumatic events that took place at the malevolent Overlook Hotel decades ago. While regularly attending AA meetings, Danny secures a job at a hospice where he comforts dying patients with a little help from his supernatural abilities, soon acquiring the title of Doctor Sleep as a result of his unorthodox methods. Meanwhile, a group of quasi-immortals operating under the moniker True Knot seek to drain the steam from within supernaturally gifted children who 'shine', just like Danny, in order to retain their youth.\n\nEnter Mike Flanagan (Oculus (2011), The Haunting of Hill House (2018)) who was burdened with the insurmountable task of not only crafting an adaptation that King himself would be proud of, but also a sequel that would impress fans of Kubrick's acclaimed original. Flanagan, who stands as one of modern horror's most prominent writer/directors right now, strikes a perfect balance with Doctor Sleep. It is a film that establishes itself as a completely different beast to Kubrick's film, while also drawing just enough influence from what's come before to please die-hard fans of what Kubrick established with his own vision. Ewan McGregor is well cast as a damaged Danny Torrance, but it's Rebecca Ferguson's captivating performance as Rose the Hat, the enigmatic leader of the True Knot, that steals the show. Fuelled with malevolence, Ferguson's deranged antagonist serves as one of Doctor Sleep's most exciting performances, and she's an absolute joy to watch. Kyliegh Curran also turns in a solid performance as Abra, a gifted young girl who shares a telepathic connection with Danny.\n\nAs is often the case with Flanagan's work, jump scares are practically non-existent. Instead, Flanagan focuses on atmosphere and tension to elevate the sequences of terror. During a grueling sequence that displays the True Knot's ability to drain children of their shine, Flanagan chooses not to hold back from depicting a scenario that will undoubtedly unease the most hardened of viewers. Stylistically speaking, Flanagan often channels Kubrick's visionary flairs to replicate certain shots that pay homage to the original film. Although both films are totally different from one another, Doctor Sleep serves as a terrific companion piece to the 1980 classic that fans of both Kubrick and King can appreciate. It's certainly an exciting journey with instances of some amazing cinematography (a sequence involving Rose scouring the night sky is a particularly captivating, dream-like moment), and Flanagan's screenplay is brilliantly paced, completely engrossing, and never dull. Doctor Sleep stands as the best Stephen King adaptation to be released this year, and one of the better horror efforts, too.

Characters finish every sentence by spelling out exactly what they're feeling and what they plan to do. There's no room for the audience to use their brains, or interpret things at any stage.\n\nOne can argue that it is wrong and unfair to compare the two films given the uniqueness of Kubrick's vision, but Doctor Sleep invites these comparisons by constantly referencing The Shining in flashbacks, in musical motif and by also relying on much of Kubrick's imagery to pedal its cheap scares. In the finale, The Overlook hotel is revisited, but the manner in which this happens turns the entire thing into a crass theme park ride, with familiar ghosts popping up here and there like cardboard cutouts waiting to be knocked down with pellet gun.

A reticent hacker who always wears a black hoodie, a software engineer who can hack into government database with ease (there is actually code from GeeksForGeeks in one of the episodes) and the extremely intelligent anti-social villain. The template characters go on and on.\n\nWhat hits the series most hard is its writing. The formulaic nature of writing makes it so predictable that it certainly doesn't go near to the thrill and suspense that a detective/crime series should. For instance, the main characters parting because of ethical differences. It has many unwarranted plotlines. Nusrat and Nikhil's past is one of them. Naina conveniently being a cybersecurity expert because it'll be required in the story later. The teacher-prodigy dynamic between Dhananjay and Nikhil is also a motif which was used but was underdeveloped. There is a major opening left for the next season but that'd been way better if the first season was good enough.\n\nIn a nutshell, Asur felt unoriginal and banal.

You'd expect that a season that is mostly filmed in just one building would be kinda boring, but it sure wasn't. Incredibly great season 3. Coven: 8.5/10 probably the most hated season of the show, but why? I loved it. Sure, it wasn't that scary and it had flaws but the casting was perfect. Lange and Emma Roberts were both perfect for their roles. Evan Peters annoyed me though, his role with the whole love triangle with Madison and Zoe was stupid. Probably my favorite season although it wasnt scary at all. 4. Freak Show: 5.5/10 Doesn't compete with the other seasons to me, the casting was good but that was about it. Overall I kinda enjoyed it, I guess? The ending was disappointing although Lange left the series in a great way. The only character I really enjoyed was the villain. Not a great season, sorry. 5. Hotel: 6.5/10 Not a very beloved season by most, but to me it was watchable and I dont feel like I wasted my time watching it. The casting was okay, Lady Gaga did great job acting and definitely added a great touch to the season but apart from that it wasn't a really interesting season all around. A lot of blood and sex but not the best season of the show. Overall I would recommend watching it although most people aren't into it. 6: Roanoke 7/10 Finally another scary season. The season felt like a haunted-House horror movie but longer. Sarah Paulson did incredible as the \"crazy, paranoid wife\". A big plot twist in the middle of the season and it left me with some confusion but I sure did enjoy this season. 7. Cult 7/10 Before the season started I was really scared I wasn't gonne like this, politics, clowns and Evan as the villian, but after watching it I actually enjoyed it. The concept was alright to me and some episodes were just boring. Again, Sarah Paulson played the crazy wife but again, she portrayed it well. Her wife was very annoying and I hoped she'd die early on but she didn't. The \"different\" episode with Frances Conroy was incredibly boring and didnt feel needed but sure let's forget about it. Sarah did a perfect job and her character was great, excited to see more of her next season.\n\nI love this show and I'm definitely excited for season 8 (Apocalypse) and season 9&10. I can understand why people dislike it but it just is your cup if tea or it isn't.

It might be a problem with the time constraints of a 90 minute or 2 hour movie, it's hard to completely capture the audience and slowly twist the perceptions.\n\nAnother thing forgotten in recent horror movies is the fact of NOT explaining everything within 5 minutes of it happening, it's more entertaining and spooky to speculate why someone sees something or what actually happened in a particular scene. People forget that in some of the best horror pictures like \"Psycho\" the real horror came from the suspense and the wondering of what was going to happen and that the violence was secondary.\n\nThe dialogue between characters is actually impressive especially in a couple scenes that you will be able to easily pick out. Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk who also created Nip/Tuck and Glee (odd combo) seem to be able to excel in almost any genre and especially now in horror. It's rare to writers like this who aren't afraid to jump around from genre to genre fearlessly.\n\nIt's hard to describe many aspects of this show without giving away to much so I must refrain from describing the plot as it appears so far.\n\nThe day after I viewed the pilot episode I was shocked to see all the negative feelings towards the content of the show. So let's be VERY clear this show is classified MA which stands for \"Mature Audiences\" which should be taken the same as and \"R\" rating for films, so if you don't want you or your kids to see it that's fine but don't get all pissy about a show you decided to watch that was marketed as a \"psycho-sexual horror\". Yes there is scenes of semi explicit sexual acts and scenes of disturbing violence but it's a horror story so images like that are to be expected.\n\nIt's refreshing to find a show that is different and does not follow traditional formula's TV horror shows. I plan to watch every week and enjoy the series fully, since it is honestly very rare to see a show do better in it's genre then most recent films.\n\nAmerican Horror Story arrived a couple weeks ago on the great FX network that also houses two of my favorite shows: \"Sons of Anarchy\" and \"Justified\".", "reviewTitle": "Different Kind of Horror", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2011-10-14", "titleId": "/title/tt1844624/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "flips49269", "userId": "/user/ur47148251/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.598060715090624, "id": "/title/tt1844624/userreviews/rw5150493", "interestingVotes": {"down": 10, "up": 30}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "We go back to 1984, only to find ourselves at another Camp Crystal Lake.

American HORROR STORY, where the only thing more terrifying than a haunted house laden with secrets that rip people to shreds, are the secrets and lies infesting the lives of one family that threaten to rip THEM to shreds.\n\nWhen a tragic miscarriage and an even more shattering act of infidelity threaten to tear apart their tenuous marriage, Ben Harmon (THE PRACTICE'S Dylan McDermott) and his wife Vivien (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Connie Britton) take their teenage daughter, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) and move away from their \"house of horrors\" to find a new start somewhere...ANYWHERE that they can put the noxious past behind them and at least try to have a go at tending to their gaping emotional wounds.\n\nThe place they choose - or maybe that chooses THEM - a run-down manse on the outskirts of L.A., turns out to be a real bargain, and though irredeemably creepy, does have an antiquated charm...if you're into murals that would give even Hieronymous Bosch nightmares.\n\nIn no short order, unsettling and strange characters - as much as the house itself is - begin to materialize and insinuate themselves into the Harmons' lives, whether they want them to or not: next-door neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange in a brilliant turn), whose demeanor suggests a deadly combo of Blanche DuBois, Norma Desmond and Gale Sondergaard's Black Widow; Frances Conroy (Ruth Fisher from SIX FEET UNDER) as the mysterious housekeeper, Moira, who appears to the rest of the family as one persona, while tempting Ben's weakness for \"a taste of strange\" with another more lascivious presence, (played by Alexandra Breckenridge); Larry Harvey (TRUE BLOOD alum Denis O'Hare), a horribly burned man who seems to be stalking Ben, and who has his own deadly history with the house and what lives there, and Constance's daughter, Adelaide, (Jamie Brewer), with Downs' Syndrome, yet who seems to have it more together - and knows more about the house - than anyone else around her.\n\nEven Ben's practice as a psychologist is fraught with peril, with the introduction of a teen patient named Tate Langdon (Evan Peters), who has an easier time picking apart and savaging the weaknesses in Ben's emotional armor than Ben does in probing his inscrutable and infuriating new charge's troubled mind. Not to mention that his growing fascination/infatuation with Violet doesn't help things one little bit.\n\nMany people have cried fowl about the show's penchant for relying heavily on old horror tropes and clich\u00e9s, without even paying attention to how it has been taking said clich\u00e9s and twisting them into newer and even more unsettling shapes than today's average hot mess passing itself off as a 'horror film.' Leave it to FX to allow Murphy and his team - much as they did with NIP/TUCK - the freedom to push the boundaries of where a horror-infused series can go, without the constraints that hog-tied many of the like-minded series that came before it, such as the ground-breaking TWIN PEAKS or American Gothic, (which wasn't anywhere near as well-written as this).\n\nTwo episodes in and I am already intrigued, grossed-out and frankly spooked by what I have seen so far.

The scariest thing so far: an 8.5 rating and a whole bunch of good reviews. Maybe its the ghosts??? \n\nWe all know the primary reason this show was 'created'. Its the money. Horror or the supernatural is trendy. Look at Twilight, True Blood, Paranormal Activity, The Walking Dead (an awesome show, by the way) and others. Just throw in some sex and you got a winner. I battled through the first season and it was rough. If it wasn't for 45 minute packages arriving every week I probably wouldn't be able to watch this horror. And I have seen all kinds of horror movies before. I am a fan of the genre. Honestly, I thought the show hit rock bottom in the Halloween episodes. But it went straight through that rock and landed in the cesspool beneath. I had extremely low expectations and it turned out to be just what I expected from Glee with ghosts, monsters and other whatnot's. Why am I disappointed by this horrible American story then? Well, there is this lack of creativity. And I mean lack as in there is no creativity. The story is a collection of every horror clich\u00e9 known to mankind. Not to mention all the plot elements that were just copied from old horror movies, polished and repainted for people who have never heard of or seen The Amytiville Horror, The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, Poltergeist and countless other movies. The house itself has a serious ghost infestation. They are everywhere. More importantly, they have abilities that are not ghost-like (if you don't understand what I'm trying to state here, watch The Shining please). They can materialize anytime and anywhere inside the house, have therapy and a prescription for Prozac, have sex with each other and with the living thus conceiving a child, hurt the living with weapons like guns and fire pokers, stealing newborn babies, eat a sandwich and drink coffee, fall in love.....This premise is completely illogical since most of them died violently, often by the hands of another ghost, and are now stuck in this house forever. No ill feelings, resentment, revenge, no making someone suffer for a long, long time ??? Apparently not.\n\nPositives? It looks good. Oh, and Miss Breckenridge in a French maid outfit.

Hitchcock never needed to mutilate people on screen to scare us.\n\nSeason 1 was decent enough, but the talent just wasn't there. When everyone started raving about Season 2 I gave in and gave the show a second chance. Season 2 just tries too hard to be shocking and cutting edge, the same way Hannibal did with an on-screen cannibalistic dinner party. \n\nI'm not even totally opposed to ultraviolence. I love movies like Planet Terror and Machete. Quentin Tarantino does ultraviolence brilliantly in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. It's in your face, it's raw, but it gives you a balance of violence that feels wrong (rape and mutilation) and violence that feels right (vengeance). As a writer, you have to throw your audience a bone every now and then. I couldn't finish season 2, to be honest.

Sort of like Heroes (also a 5)-- and no scarier-- the show relentlessly churns and twists to surprising reveal after surprising reveal all delivered with maximum pathos, though a fair share of the performances are good. There is never once a scary moment--- quick cuts and lots of goofy canted shots pretty much guarantee there is never any atmosphere, unless you think music videos are atmospheric. The heavy handed music choices don't help, excepting the cool whistling bit and the piece that sounds stolen from Wojciech Kilar's superb score for (the otherwise crappy) Coppola-directed Dracula (I don't like to put Bram Stoker's name at the front of that one.) \n\nSo AHS functions as a fast moving and surprising soap opera with a big budget, some good make up fx and some decent acting, which is why it gets a 5. Actually had the last double length episode not been the series nadir--- really bad dialogue and spacious melodrama that fails utterly--- the show would be slightly north of mediocre, but 'afterbirth' is pretty stinky, and the penultimate episode 'birth' not much better.\n\nLike most Stephen King stuff that I don't like*, it is essentially modern day fantasy with too much explanation of everything so it barely even functions as suspense, much less horror. Ghosts as lead characters who can appear and disappear at will puts this in a camp with things like Ghost (yes, the Swayze one) and Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. If you think Ghost and Blithe Spirit are horror, then American Horror Story is horror, but I don't (and you shouldn't) even if AHS has occasional gore and burn make up.\n\nOverall, American Horror Story is a mildly engaging soap with better than average acting for a soap and a lot more blood than the average soap, but actually less creepy than the original Dark Shadows show, which actually had atmosphere and let the scenes breathe (and had better music as well).\n\n*Horror guys I dig are the old school of Lovecraft, Blackwood and Machen, and also the visceral and immediate books of high tension storyteller Richard Laymon.", "reviewTitle": "If R Kelly and M.

Post season 2, it becomes so dull that a viewer can actually predict what is going to happen in the end of the episode. The episodes, apart from following the main story line, follows the same track - in EACH ONE OF THEM! I am writing this review after pausing in the middle of the latest episode, which tells a lot about its quality I guess.\n\nOkay, so the characters downgrades episode to episode. They start irritating you. The characters and dialogues makes you feel as if you are seeing so much sweetness that it's making you want to throw up. And the viewer starts to pissed off for the fact thinking that why the hell these characters have to always talk about their 'feelings' which get hurt over such stupid little things that one feels like giving them a good thrashing. All that uninteresting, monotonous emotional drama makes it so whimsical that it actually makes the viewer think \"Whining bit**es\" about the characters. Which makes a person wonder that after so many fights and dealing with losses, why are these dolts (the characters) still stupid and have not become more matured. Which reminds me - why are they not killing or sending that stupid Ralph (Plastic man) away and why the hell they keep bringing that Wells guy back in every season in some new form!\n\nThe science they use and the scientific explanations they give are just so damn ridiculous and extremely stupid that it makes you wonder that whether they are some Arts Grads posing as scientists, making stuff up as they go! I mean - Extracting powers and treating and changing the DNA with a liquid in a test tube! Do they even know what the DNA is! By the way who the hell pays for that Star Labs - for the surplus amount of electricity they are using along with all the costs that are or could be incurred by such a huge establishment in size? RIDICULOUS! Idiotic!\n\nThere is nothing different in the episodes and the characters starts to become so irritating - (I don't know how to describe it in any better way) promoting Modernism so much so that the viewer starts to wonder that in which part of the world people are like that and then thanks his luck that he does not live in that part of the world. It makes the characters look shallow and overly superficial in subtle ways (sometimes not even subtle!). I can go on and on, there are just so many flaws!\n\nI'd recommend to watch Daredevil series or the Punisher series on Netflix which are so splendidly made (well compared to this crap).

They are write themselves into corners, then just go to cheap tools to erase it, only to write themselves into the next corner. \n\nSo it happens that the Flash is fast enough to vibrate through a gasoline truck, hell, he's even so fast, that he goes back in time! But... wait, there's a guy with some bees, and the Flash is powerless. Oh noes, a guy who has little toys that will follow you: Flash is powerless. A guy with a gun that shoots a ray of ice that travels slower than the water of a waterhose? Flash is powerless. Oh, did I say that the Flash can catch a bullet that is being shot at the back of his head, without turning around? Yeah, that is no problem. \n\nBut everything else is. So he relies on a team of specialists, who work in a high tech underground lab - that any enemy can penetrate, as long as they have a hand to open the door lol.\n\nThe acting: The actors really try as hard as they can to be worse than the writing, and they almost make it. But like when trying to act, they fail here too. Iris and her Dad have the range of glue stuck to glue, and everybody else does a really awful at it too. \n\nThere is NO consistency, no logic, no real drama (who EVER thought for one second, that Barry really is about to die? be honest!). The show is just one big assassination of one of DCs coolest and (normally) funniest characters. \n\nI wish I could be at the intellectual level of a plant or gum under the table, cause then I could enjoy the series about one of my favorite characters.

So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.\n\nThe writers (and the actors!) do a great job in creating new characters that are as strange and somewhat over the top as most of the iconic Coen creations we've come to love over the years - and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Lorne Malvo' (from season 01) has the potential to reach cult status. Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it. \n\nThe cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did.

From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.\n\nSeason 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills. All in all, Season 1 of Fargo was really the one I was waiting for these whole 6 months and I didn't want to end this beautiful experience, so I immediately decided to watch Season 2.\n\nSeason 2: Everyone who watched season 1 will have some idea about how season 2 will go on. It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale. I'm glad they renewed it for the next season and I really can't wait for that.\n\nThe music utilized over the two seasons is absolutely mind blowing, the way it relates to each and every scenario is just spectacular. Along with this awesome music, the outstanding piece of poetry depicts the ongoing lives of the people in Fargo. The direction part is really masterful and you can clearly see that in the second season\".

I was in a way wondering if I was just wasting my time and watching a series that would fall short of everyone's expectations and just flop, like so many other TV series do nowadays. However, that didn't happen at all.\n\nThe performances were outstanding in my opinion. Martin Freeman was excellent and to my surprise did the accent fairly well. Billy Bob Thornton was amazing as Lorne Malvo, the enigmatic vibe you get from his performance gave me chills.\n\nThe cinematography is also one of the good things about this pilot. The shots are smart and intriguing, yet still simple and not too overdone. The music is also outstanding. There are times when it is quirky and funny, there are times where it is tragic and sad yet epic, and then there are also the times when it is intense and mysterious.\n\nFargo is mysterious, intense, funny (at times), tragic and just simply plain awesome!

Noah Hawley writes with his brain open and succeeds in making a point or two. His tale is driven my 2014's best background score. If you doubt that, try searching Google for the \"Mr. Numbers & Mr. Wrench\" track and you will see how nuts is the web for the music.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I was skeptical after the first episode but now I am positive.

Just from watching the first 4 episodes of season 3, you can see Shawshank redemption mirrored in the situation Archie is in (some form of prison or jail sentence)... From the warden, the written phrase framed in the wardens office to what is in my opinion is the most evident form of proof, the rock hammer Archie found in the bible...\n\nAt first I was disappointed, later deciding to overlook those miniscule details in the episode. Then came the next few episodes. The writers decide to implement a thrilling game into the show as they implement a board game, changing \"dungeons and dragons\" to \"gryphons and gargoyles\". Next, the flashback episode, featuring a late 80's or mid 90's group called the \"midnight club\" similar to that of \"the breakfast club\". The similarities are uncanny, and unfortunately these examples don't even begin to include the dialogue in other scenes which mirror the movies that writers have been \"inspired\" by as well... Frankly, I'm disappointed.

Yes, I know, '13 Reasons Why' came afterwards, but the similarities are uncanny. ...Formulaic moody voice-over protagonist examining laughably clich\u00e9 and shallow life-lessons at the start of each episode with an ongoing 'dark' mystery that I have literally no interest in discovering 'who the killer is'... ...This is, quite literally, the g-rated version of '13 Reason Why'. The baby brother that should have been aborted long ago.\n\nI'm hate watching this show just to laugh at how bad the writing is, and how over-the-top the actors are in reading the lines. I genuinely feel sorry for all of the cast involved, since they are all stunningly gorgeous, late 20-somethings, for what is supposed to be a high school drama.\n\nA lot of investment has gone into the production values, episode direction and 'Glee'-like songs, but that doesn't make up for the horribly predictable 1 bit characters.\n\nI guess, since this is based on a terribly banal comic strip, that I'm supposed to look the other way, and expect it to just be a skin- deep romp. Like watching the movie-version of 'Battleship', knowing, and accepting, that there isn't any real substance underlying the content of what the show is originally based off of.\n\nIt's a shame really. I feel like this could have been something, had there been just ever so slightly a bit more comedy and charm worked into the characters. The only saving grace is Betty's gay best friend, who provides a strikingly blunt and hilarious perspective at times, and is seemingly always down to rave. He is a teen version of 'Elijah' from 'Girls'.\n\nContrast him, with the main character Archie. ... Archie is the most hatable character, despite always having the smoothest things to say to work him out of the most terribly awkward situations. He never lies to anyone, but it's laughable how everyone fawns over his presence and excuses his poor decisions.\n\nFor instance, one minor plot spoiler here... I find it really hard to watch and empathize with a high school football captain jock, who friend zones his smoking hot best friend while in the process of having a scandalous affair with his music teacher. Oh, and when his love triangle explodes, everyone gives him a pass with even his father basically patting him on the back and saying 'it's not your fault'. Really? It's not? Are you sure? Something feels terribly off about the entire ordeal.\n\nA. He's dating a teacher. While this has been done before in other shows, 'Boston Public' comes to mind... ...Here it feel very... very... wrong and superficial. In one episode he acknowledges that he's just having fun with her and celebrating the present with little regard to what repercussions their relationship may have on his family/friends/her career. In the next, he's demanding commitment, and then parting ways with her while gifting her a cello string.\n\nI guess, we're supposed to roll our eyes and accept it. But there's something very cringe-worthy in doing that, as it is with so many other aspects of this show (such as, watching cheerleaders twerk to a hiphop remixed song of 'sugar sugar').\n\nThere's a very no-good, terrible vibe, underlying this entire show, Laughing off very real subjects with terrible dialogue, predictable plot twists, and glitzy dance numbers.\n\n...And now I've written too much about a show that isn't worth my spit.

I started watching it following a friend's recommendation, but I warn everyone who is fortunate enough to read my review before it's too late; do not watch this show. I will help you out by outlining a few of the reasons why you want to avoid Riverdale.\n\nThe main issue with Riverdale is the way it deals with its two main story lines: the murder of Jason Blossom and the incredibly unrealistic love rectangle involving Archie, Veronica, Betty and Geraldine Grumby. When I started watching Riverdale, I was hoping for the main focus to be on the murder mystery, however the truth is that the writers prefer to devote most of the plot time to Archie's teen high school crushes. Most of all, I hate the way every female character in the show instantly falls in love with Archie. I can't fathom why this is the case considering he is probably the most boring character in the Riverdale universe. He is literally a whiny bitch who we are apparently supposed to root for because of his \"great\" body and passion for music, even though none of the songs he writes are even mildly impressive. My dislike of Archie further stems from the way he treats his supposed best friend Betty. Almost immediately after Betty confesses that she has feelings for Archie, he goes in a locker with their mutual friend and makes out with her when he could have either left the party or just pretended to go along with it. It's also just totally stupid because Archie, who is 15 BTW, apparently loves his music teacher: Mrs Grumby. Confused? So am I... What's disappointing is that all of the time wasted on these love triangles and angsty romances that belong in Twilight and The Vampire Diaries could have been spent on developing an original and interesting murder mystery. It has gotten to the point where I hardly care who killed Jason anymore. I think that one major improvement to the story would have been if they had gone into more detail about Jason's past (perhaps through flashbacks) to pique the viewer's interest. \n\nOther issues with Riverdale are more minor, although collectively they are sufficient to drive me away from the show. Firstly, all of the actors on the show are way too old for the roles they are playing. I know that it is standard procedure for adults to play teenage roles in most TV series, but most of them honestly look like they are in their late twenties. Secondly, the romance between Archie and the music teacher is technically rape, yet the writers almost seem to romanticize it. Kind of creepy to be honest. Lastly, as someone else mentioned on here, the show just feels incredibly clich\u00e9. Just like in every Young Adult adaptation, there is the \"Mean girl\", the gay best friend, the jock and endless love triangles. Wow the writers were creative with this one!\n\nI know you will probably dismiss me as a hater after seeing the overwhelming number of positive reviews for this show on IMDb. My explanation for this however is that the expectations and standard of TV shows has seriously decreased in recent years. In the past, there were brilliant shows such as Lost and Buffy that brought new premises to television and were genuinely entertaining to watch. Now it seems every show uses the same plot, with a slightly different spin, and resorts to using eye candy to hook in viewers. I just hope this trend eventually ends. \n\nAnyway, just don't waste your time with Riverdale. You will have seen it all before on some other trashy show.", "reviewTitle": "Seen it all before", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2017-02-20", "titleId": "/title/tt5420376/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "GomezAddams666", "userId": "/user/ur59148101/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5704033302753438, "id": "/title/tt5420376/userreviews/rw3627698", "interestingVotes": {"down": 198, "up": 314}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I knew going dark on the Archie Comics would be a bad idea, I just didn't know it would suck this much.\n\nThis show is Dawson's Creek meets Scream Queens meets every other High School drama that ever existed, it's as if someone decided to take every single clich\u00e9d teenage character out there and put it together in a story about a small town murder.\n\nIt has the cheerleaders, the football players, the loner blogger, the gay best friend, the \"in the down low\" gay football player, the love triangle, the queen bee, the out of towner, the repressed teen who has been a goody two shoes trying to \"be herself\"... Jesus Christ, do TV writers think viewers have an IQ of 3 or something? How pathetic of an attempt to adapt a story this was? Did the director's cousin wrote this? Can the producers get their money back? Can I get an hour wasted watching this back?\n\nAnd to top it all of, they just had to do this like Gossip Girl and MTV's SCREAM, where someone is narrating the story because the target audience is to freaking stupid to follow a basic story line. Although there wasn't a story line to follow, and maybe Jughead was just trying to narrate to make this stupid story seem lest boring and less pathetic, but nothing could save this boat load of crap.\n\nI remember the old Archie comics and maybe because they were cheesy they haven't been brought to the screen properly, but that definitely does not mean to take this story and make it this freaking dark.

Sounds like \"Twin Peaks\".\n\nThe show features the characters we expect, but they are multi-dimensional, with problems and desires and secrets. Archie sees himself as flawed, but he wants to make music his life and vocation. Betty (his best friend) sees herself as inadequate, but she wants Archie to be more than a friend.

Others may grow weary of the usual tropes: the mean head cheerleader, the gay best friend, the closeted gay jock, the handsome athletic main character, the first day at the new school for the outsider. \"Glee\" explored many of them. And some of them date back to the forties, when Andy Hardy (the original inspiration for Archie comics) entertained us all with his teenage dramas.

Then Season 2 rolls around and I have to ask, what the actual ****? \n\nSeason 2 is all over the place and it ruins any credibility that Season 1 had built up. The plot is all over the place. We are trying to find another killer but then discover who it is not even half way through the season in a very lackluster way. \n\nThe character change opinions and personalities more than I change socks. Jughead goes from \"I hate the Serpents!\" To going through a grueling task to join them the very next episode and then goes from the voice of reason to literally skinning a woman's arm well she is alive and not even showing any kind of emotion. In what? Two days someone went from \"we need to help everyone!\" to \"hold her down, I'm gonna cut off her skin!\" Kevin goes from openly gay flamboyant guy who is kissing people in public in Season 1 to apparently the entire town going homophobic in Season 2 and Kevin needing to hide in the woods at night to even touch a mans hand, all to raise the stakes of who might be killed next. Then Betty and her brother have this honestly cringe worthy bit where they try to discover the cause of this \"inner-darkness.\" like it's fricken hereditary or something. \n\nThat aside, the next thing that makes this show unwatchable is the editing. It jumps EVERYWHERE! One episode was set up like this:\n\n Archie and Veronica talk for 20 seconds, Betty says she is going to visit her brother (5 second scene), Jughead tries to phone betty (15 second scene), jump back to Archie and Veronica talking for about 20 seconds, jump to Kevin getting into trouble (10 second scene), jump back to Archie and Veronica surprising Fred for about 30 seconds, jump back to Betty walking into a hall to see her brother being beaten, back to Jughead talking about Betty, Fred acts surprised, jump back to Betty saving her brother. \n\nYou see where I'm going with this? In about 2 minutes you have about 40 scenes. They cut everything into little tiny bits then stretch it the entire 45 minutes as a poor attempt at creating suspense. I'd much rather see the scenes in full. Instead of jumping 20 times back to Betty and her brother for 15 seconds at a time, how about have two scenes lasting 3 minutes each. that way the viewers aren't being tossed back and forth between scenes and given no time to remember what was happening.\n\nIt's a mess.

The comic books aren't your 1950s Archie either any more. Archie, Jughead and the rest of the gang have been updated and dropped into the \"real\" world both in the comics and now on television. \n\nI was never much of an Archie fan, leaning more towards the superhero and horror genres when I was younger, but I was aware of Archie on the periphery of my comic book reading habits. Occasionally I'd read a book or two but they never struck me as something I wanted to read regularly. So when this series was announced I went in with a little bias and actually didn't want to like it. I had too many shows competing for my time as it was. But I decided to give it a shot. I wanted to see what this updated, teen drama Archie had to offer. \n\nImmediately, with the murder mystery I started getting a Rob Thomas Veronica Mars vibe from it and that is not a bad thing. Riverdale was suddenly layered and mysterious, yet still filled with characters you knew from Archie and Betty, to Pops and the Pussycats. These were people you could identify with with actual personalities beyond the pulp four color comic book world you remember them from. And they were eyeball deep in a mystery that had real consequences. And we got to learn about not just the \"gang\", but also their parents and some periphery characters that were rarely touched on in the comics. And best of all, the goofy sidekick Jughead is a much more interesting character and the narrator of the series showing him to be an intelligent person far beyond the hamburger munching cartoon of a character he is in the books.\n\nI have just finished the season finale and look forward to the next season.

Casting big names for this show was a horrible mistake when they were unable to sing and dance, in a show that is ALL about singing and dancing. Taylor Swift's cat, Bombarlarina, should be pink, not an orange tabby. She was also in like 10 min when this cat is one of the MAIN CHARACTERS. The cat Rebel Wilson plays is a TAP DANCER. This didn't happen. Old Dueteronomy is a male baritone cat (literally the FATHER OF ALL THE CATS. It says it in the song!!)

What even happened to the choreography at the JELLICLE Ball? The song was like 2 min! This is just the tip of the iceberg. I could go on for DAYS!\n\nI know there is a lot of talk about \"fixing\" some of the CGI and releasing a new version, but honestly, I don't know what they expect to fix. The CGI was not the worst part. The lack of actually musical talent was, in other words, the entire movie needs to be remade with real broadway performers.\n\nI can go on and on about what was wrong with the specific cats and musical numbers, but my review would likely be more than 50 pages.

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Mis\u00e9rables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Mis\u00e9rables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.", "reviewTitle": "A disastrous show of pompous and inconsequential gibberish, garish visuals and tedious storytelling", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-21", "titleId": "/title/tt5697572/"}], "totalReviews": 1551}, "tt9779516": {"@type": "imdb.api.userreviews.userreviewsfortitle", "base": {"id": "/title/tt9779516/", "image": {"height": 2880, "id": "/title/tt9779516/images/rm2204534273", "url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTczOTM1ZGEtNzkyNS00NGRmLWI3YjEtZmRlOGZmMzgzNzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMxOTE0ODA@._V1_.jpg", "width": 1944}, "title": "I Still Believe", "titleType": "movie", "year": 2020}, "paginationKey": "g4wp7dbfqi3tizqg66uhhnzrrdt4ucbyy4hhzo5ziwr26fbyhvrl4ty4ou2frmzjdjv5dtvhlsqbz3pbbuugk5eiygob4ywc", "reviews": [{"author": {"displayName": "downthehobbitholeblog", "userId": "/user/ur82535977/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.46947989027204695, "id": "/title/tt9779516/userreviews/rw5548706", "interestingVotes": {"down": 11, "up": 20}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "The tear-jerking true story of musician Jeremy Camp and his journey of love, loss, musical success and faith.

They're immensely talented filmmakers. But their films are part of a new emergent Christianity where it's become a rock-star religion - the most popular speakers, the most popular bands, the most popular churches, the most popular everything. And the Lord Jesus Christ is always given a supporting role.\n\nIf you carefully watch their previous film 'I Can Only Imagine', the Erwin Brothers spend more time on Amy Grant than Jesus Christ. In fact, Christ is completely MIA in that film. It's like he's a cool Cross symbol hanging on the neck of Madonna.\n\nAmerican Christianity has become a corporation.\n\nIt's filled with Christian publicists trying to get the Erwin Brothers on Fox Morning News. They try to find some 'angle' that will make people go and see their movie. Maybe a cool blogger? Again, it's not about Jesus at all. It's about galvanizing millions of these Christian music fans to watch the film and bring in millions of dollars in revenue. Like with \"I Can Only Imagine\" - a film that to this day I have no clue where the true Christ is.\n\nPut another way, would an elderly 80-year old woman who was a missionary to PNG her whole life be advertised at Harvest Crusade, the National Religious Broadcaster's (NRB) conference, Joel Osteen's church, etc?\n\nOf course not. It's always the most popular speakers, the most popular bands, the most popular authors, etc. It's worse than the coronavirus. Really it is.\n\nAmerican Christianity has become a popularity contest.\n\nCan you see Jesus or His disciples doing this? Do you see them selling tickets to hear Jesus speak? Telling their listeners to buy their books, movies, CD's?\n\n\"Come hear Jesus speak! We also have Jeremy Camp, Mercy Me, Amy Grant singing! And popular speakers Greg Laurie and Joel Osteen also talking before Jesus! Get your tickets now!\"\n\nIt's all about being hip and cool. This 'emergent' new American Christianity that started in 1982.\n\nIn the meantime, this army of luke-warm Believers continue to buy t-shirts, pay for concerts, attend conferences - and help perpetuate this incredibly dangerous mindset that Christ has a price tag. A monetary value. A box office gross.\n\nCome hear Hillsong at the Compaq Center - tickets on sale this Monday! VIP Section seats only $175.\n\nAmerican Christianity has become an embarrassment.\n\nIt's an embarrassment to all the persecuted Christians in the world.\n\nThe emergent Christian filmmakers would never make a movie about persecuted Christians. Why? Because no one would go. It's all about making money and being popular with them. They will deny this, of course.\n\nAmerican Christianity - and there's no other way to put this - has become a false religion.\n\nThis is why poll after poll shows there's no difference between American Christians and the secular heathen. Divorce rates, depression rates, suicidal thoughts, etc - all the same.\n\nA false religion? That's too strong, right? Only if you believe a luke-warm Christian is not an oxymoron. You will not see a luke-warm Christian in heaven. Just read Matthew 7:21-23: \"Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me...\"\n\nYou can tell a luke-warm Christian a mile away because of these 5 words: \"That. Doesn't. Apply. To. Me.\"\n\nSo this Scripture doesn't apply to them: \"You adulterers! Don't you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.\" James 4:4\n\nIt's all about pursuing holiness. Not pursuing fame, riches, or popularity. Instead of supporting this American Christian 'industry' - jump on a plane and help bring Bibles to Afghanistan. Oh wait - that would be outside your comfort zone as an American Christian. My pastor at my popular church said I don't have to preach the Gospel. I can work at my 9-5 job and be fine with that! I'll save that good thought though. Thank you!

The acting was fine and stuff, but unfortunately, it felt like the film's bad outweighed the good. This is supposed to be the inspiring story of Jeremy Camp, but all it did was show me that God takes backseat to love. It was supposed to be about a man's relationship with God and his story though that, but the religious factor was shoved way back. Heck, Pale Rider had more to do with God than thus film. I watched for good long while, and before you know it, you forget that this is supposed to be a religious film and it turns out to be a less-faithful Walk to Remember. God's name isn't said till around over a half-hour into the film. It just seemed more like a typical romance film. \"Oh, I love you, but oh, this guy loves you, and oh, you don't want to hurt his feelings, and oh, he finds out anyways and is pissed.\" I just described a good chunk of chick-flicks. And yes, I know that this film was supposed to appeal more to female audiences who enjoy those movies, but please. The thing that made A Walk to Remember so great is that the main focus wasn't supposed to be on God, rather it was an incredible explanation to why the female protagonist was so kind and loving, yet they made it known to the point where it was relevant and an important piece of the story. The point was, A Walk to Remember was a romance film with some religious backstory, but it gave more credit to God and God was more important than in I Still Believe. I Still Believe was supposed to be about a Christian artist and his walk with the Lord and such, but had less to do with God than a movie that uses God as an explanation to some questions. That is sad. They constantly do all this stuff, but over 30 minutes in, they're like \"Oh, yeah, God is supposed to be a part of this movie, might as well use him as a dating tactic.\" The first reference to God IN A CHRISTIAN FILM is when Jeremy tried to deceivingly use God as an excuse to go out with a girl. The girl references to God a minute earlier, but it was so irrelevant that it could easily be forgotten. The first thing that sticks out is \"Yo, what if God WANTED us to be together?\" Then you just realize it's not a Christian film, just a romance-drama with some Jesus sprinkled in to sell to a Christian audience. This must have also been sad for the man who this story was actually based off of, because instead of showing in the movie how God changed his life, it just showed that it could be a less heartbreaking, less religious Walk to Remember.

I also liked that the more well known artist wanted the writer to get the credit for his own song. So I hoped that \"I still believe\" might be similarly good. It's made by the same directing team.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of \"I still beleive\" is just bad. A lot of the dialogue is cheesy or inaccurate. The love story is annoying. It had a dumb love triangle that made me annoyed at all 3 members of the triangle. Paticularly the girl who we're supposed to be most supportive of when she later gets cancer.\n\nThe movie has instances of people treating known medical things like remission as miracles. They never thank the doctors and in one case go against the doctors suggestion. They never present any of the bad things as negative signs against god or God's kindness like they do for all of the positive moments. I like optimism. But at a certain point there needs to be some sense falsifiability in order for the belief to be reasonable.\n\nThere is a terrible song where the singer seeks to be \"used by God.\" I found that more than a little creepy.

The subtle messages and radiant leads stick their landing without feeling preachy. Adults and kids will admire this faith-based tale, perhaps in a matinee and a box of tissues.\n\nThis story brings the true-life story of Christian music star Jeremy Camp (KJ Apa) and his remarkable journey with his wife Melissa (Britt Robertson). Their faith in God is tested when Melissa is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Still, Jeremy believes there is always hope and a faith worth sharing through his music and memories.\n\nThe two leads share great chemistry allowing for a believable relationship. KJ Apa, as Jeremy Camp, steps into the shoes of the Christian music singer, through his original music and devotion towards his wife Melissa. Speaking of which, Britt Robertson, as Melissa, is the best performance nailing the emotional gravitas of the real-life counterpart's plight. She fares much better in emotional scenes, and while KJ has great screen presence, he could improve his emotional chops. Both characters absolutely deliver a heart-warming dynamic that makes the ending all the more tragic, but also reminiscing. Nathan Dean, as Jean-Luc, adds a love-triangle dynamic that feels more at home in a CW show than a dramatic real-life story. Still, his character is charismatic and relatable in his struggles. Gary Sinise, as Tom, is Jeremy's father, adding more heart to Jeremy's unwavering love and choices.\n\nDirectors Andrew and Jon Erwin return after directing the Christian film I Can Only Imagine. The Erwins have a good grasp on not being preachy and instead, focus on the human relationships that bind. However, this film's first half panders with one instance of egregious product placement, unbecoming of its more mature second half. It feels tonally inconsistent in spite of KJ and Britt's natural chemistry. There's a scene involving a broken jar of pickles where the film becomes thoughtfully complacent about its conflicts. This is where the film began to click, and it ends up being moving and lyrically heartwarming.\n\nThe message of this film is to always keep the faith and stay close to those you love. They make us for who we are, and unfortunately, tragic things can happen. It's best that we stay close and not waste any day with them.\n\nI give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18 due to strong thematic material.

This film is a work of art and I love it. The exposition is very clear and interesting. A lot of reviews that give this film a bad rating seem to miss the point by far. You should not watch this film in means of pointing out the plot holes only to be disappointed by the ending. I find it very sad that people are complaining about the wrong things and not getting the whole picture.\n\nThis should not be taking literally. People seem to think that every movie is like a MARVEL movie meaning you can watch it with one eye closed and then complain about the ending because it did not hand everything out to you. This movie is a study on human mind and psychology In the end, the man sacrifices himself for the greater good, not about the girl, not about him surviving nor escaping.\n\nAlso I've noticed that the bad reviews come from people who want things explained to them. Things like government in this movie is just an explanation for the whole \"prison\" system to be justified. Suspension of disbelief. Why do these things need to be explained, when everything's that needs to be pointed out, is.\n\nIt's a very philosophical film and interesting that makes you think deeply about the situation, and how when humans are put into this system, the system takes over and all the good in humans vanishes. And the point is that, it's not our fault. We are programmed like that, and can't do nothing about it. The ending was perfect, doesn't matter what happened to the girl, you'll need to figure out that by yourself. And by that I don't mean theorizing literally where did she end up, but instead what was the point of the girl, the message they had to deliver ground floor, was there really even a message needed to be delivered, or was it just for nothing.\n\nNow maybe some answers could be found trom the book Don Quixote, haven't read it, but after this I reckon I will at some point. There was this quote in the end from the book that went something like It's how you use your prosperity and wealth, not how much you have it. That sums up the whole meaning of this prison system, and may be my favorite quote ever among some others.\n\nAnd especially what makes this film marvelous is that it delivers this concept perfectly, I didn't get the feeling of \"oh well great concept but It could've had been done better, because I feel that the director got his message through.\n\nAlso what I find very interesting is how at the top, where the food was being made, the guy who was responsible for it all, was very picky about how perfect the food had to be and even the tiniest of hair in the food was not acceptable: I KNOW that that is an allegory, just can't figure to what.

Simple yet compelling complexities to the scenario are introduced and teased out in a satisfying enough way.\n\nI am a hard core sci-fi fan and as such I do like grand reveals and some closure a the end of the movie. This film provides neither but somehow that's OK and I realised to my surprise that despite the lack of these elements I had enjoyed it very much. If you don't like slow burn's or intellectual explorations of existential dilemma's blah blah blah then you should probably skip it.\n\nBut if you like content that makes you think and a film you can sink into I believe you will enjoy this.

Once per day, a platform containing a vast array of food set out like a banquet lowers itself through each floor. The people on each level are given two minutes per day to eat and then the platform moves down a level until it reaches the bottom. There are three simple rules\n\n(1) Each prisoner may bring one item into the prison. (2) No food may be kept off the platform from the platform else your cell will be heated or chilled to extreme temperatures. (3) Every month the prisoners are moved to a different level of the prison.\n\nThese three plots may sound basic enough but the film takes us deep into the greed and selfishness of humans. Given that you don't know what level you will end up on every month, needless to say those in the upper levels will gorge themselves leaving no food. The lower the platform goes, the less food due to the greed of those on the upper levels. It shoes heavy parallels to society where the elites of society have no desire to share their wealth and those on the bottom suffer. The film also has an interesting take on social behaviour in that every month you are randomly placed on a level and so one day you may be on top with as much food as you want, the next you're down the bottom starving to death - a situation any of us could experience in real life - one day you're a working man and the next you're homeless.\n\nI caught this film on Netflix as it just showed up and I'm glad I took a chance and watched it. B grade, low budget, but delivers a powerful message. It's akin to films such as Ink, The Man from Earth, Cube, The Circle - all low budget films with exceptional story telling and brilliant acting.\n\nYou will empathise and sympathise with every single character.

The platform is our world, and the administration are the governments, and the levels are the social classes that are created. The administration (government) works with care, but due to flaws in the capitalist system, there are people suffering/dying.\n\nThe main character Goreng has norms. However, it doesn't take too much until he loses his mind in a corrupt world. He wakes up in the platform with an old man, who is completely aware about the system, and has already completely adapted. When he is up, he eats as much as he can and abuses it. When he's down, he does everything needed to stay alive. The woman that formerly worked for the administration regrets her earlier duties of sending people in to the platform, as she 'didn't know' - depicting similar people that work for governments nowadays. She regrets it, hence sends herself in and tries to change the system by speaking up to the lower level everyday. However, the tone of her message is not enough in the cruel world; Goreng's tone that includes threatening seems to work though.\n\nGoreng tries to change the entire system with Baharat. I think, that ultimately they failed, and that starting from some part of going down (I am not sure from where), Goreng starts to hallucinate. Initially, they are trying to send a message to the administration by sending back untouched clean food - which is normally impossible in their system. They fail in this, but Goreng, imagines a bigger message: in the lower levels, no one is interested in food from the table anyways; they are eating each other. A child that survives the bottom floor would serve as a bigger message, as she is a metaphor to our social norms and ties. Baharat tried to go up several times, but going up does not have anything to do with willingness. There are always people that are going to stop you. It is a matter of luck, just like in the movie. One day you wake up in a horrific situation, the other day you are happier. When you are happy (or of higher class), you seem to forget about the bad days and lose your emphaty as a human being and exaggerate in every act that you do.\n\nThe woman that worked for the administration thought that there were 200 levels. The movie describes that there is always worse and way more people suffering than they seem to observe - so bad that the world and the governments (the woman) do not realize (or tend to ignore) while being part of the system.\n\nOverall, I think it was a great movie.

Director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia is having a blast delivering a well-aimed allegory about the alarming and real inequality of our society, he has succeeded both philosophically and cinematically. The cast, every one of the characters, does an impressive job bringing this parable to life, with good character writing putting the dot on i. \"The Platform\", set in such a grim and claustrophobic environment, is visually pretty imprevise, well done cinematography, both practical and digital effects and just provides a high-tier overall look. There's a fair amount of violence as well, of the no-cheese kind. Last but not least, \"The Platform\" is carried back and forth with an atmospheric and effectively subtle original score.\n\n\"The Platform\" is as substantial and compelling as it is entertaining, in the 90 minutes there's enough interesting themes, characters and twists to get kicks out of. Smaller flaws include slower pacing in the second half, an ending that, I imagine, might feel too open for some, but all in all it's a horror movie worth seeing.

It is great for futuristic sci-fi fans, horror fans, gore hounds, mystery lovers, or dystopian fans. Most people will be drawn in to the basic but puzzling premise.\n\nHowever, as so many other films of late, it is obvious that the globalist message and communist manifesto messages are hard at work to plant themselves into your brain. In fact, early on, the man's cellmate even says to him, \"What the hell are You? A communist?\" I knew that more PC brainwashing was in store for us from there. Still, I will give the writers credit for showing some valid realities about world history and societies, which are somewhat inevitable in human existence thus far.\n\nEven with the best intentioned communists, there WILL ALWAYS BE A HIERARCHY. Just as in Orwell's Animal Farm, SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS. I guess that is the most disturbing fact that I worry about most people not comprehending-- they are returning to some lust for socialism, communism, cultural Marxism, and the belief that governments of man can solve all human problems and inequality, while stamping out and silencing the \"evil dissenters\". The problem is that humanity is infinitely flawed and corrupt, regardless, and these supposedly universal and benevolent systems end up flipping on the masses just like capitalism, monarchy, or any other previous system they rail against. At least with capitalism and free markets-- you actually have a chance to do better and have somewhat of a voice and free will, whether you make it or not. The past century has clearly shown us that capitalism is far superior, as is giving the public incentives to earn wealth and barter as they choose. It is not perfect, but neither is humanity. Communism in its modern form is really just another means for bankers to liquidate and control the wealth, assets, and lives of the sheep, for the elite party at the top. It is not the grassroots workers movement for equality it masquerades itself to be. For more on this, study the Russian Revolution, and how it was widely financed and associated with bankers, Western sympathizers, and secret societies with other goals in mind.\n\nAll that aside, the movie was still good, but could have been much better with a little longer runtime that develops the plot and ends with more satisfaction. As It winds to a close, it seems to run out of time to wrap up the story, and has to rush to a disappointing plot hole conclusion. They didn't have to reveal ALL of the mystery, but having a few more details or reveals would not hurt, and some of the plot holes around the Asian lady and the kid are a bit unfulfilling. I say 6 or 7, but the first half is more close to a 9.

It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\n\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\n\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\n\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\n\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10", "reviewTitle": "Some birds aren't meant to be caged.", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2010-07-24", "titleId": "/title/tt0111161/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "carflo", "userId": "/user/ur2509775/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.8798272931862414, "id": "/title/tt0111161/userreviews/rw0349418", "interestingVotes": {"down": 403, "up": 3272}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption?

Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.\n\nAfter opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.\n\nFirstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.\n\nIt's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.\n\nWith themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed.

And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.\n\nForget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. \n\nSome liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. \n\nHow ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. \n\nAnyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. \n\nBut every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part.

Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope.

To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.\n\nThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.\n\nBy creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.\n\nWhile maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.\n\nWith work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.\n\nWith all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.\n\nThis film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich\u00e9s and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.", "reviewTitle": "Shawshank Redeems Hollywood", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2002-08-27", "titleId": "/title/tt0111161/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "baumer", "userId": "/user/ur0355122/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.8001394001485671, "id": "/title/tt0111161/userreviews/rw0348302", "interestingVotes": {"down": 153, "up": 729}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.\n\nThis is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.\n\nKing is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. \n\nWhat makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.\n\nI'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94.

None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.

The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.\n\nTim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW.

In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.\n\nIn this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.\n\nOne of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.\n\n\"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,\" from \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\n\nAs bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share.

I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.\n\nSo I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.\n\nMany people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.\n\nMany unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.\n\nIn this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.\n\nIt's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.\n\nThe miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.\n\nThis is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.\n\nThe trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.\n\nSo, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.", "reviewTitle": "Busy dying or busy living?", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2002-09-01", "titleId": "/title/tt0111161/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "blairgallop7", "userId": "/user/ur15148249/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6469088247545023, "id": "/title/tt0111161/userreviews/rw1790341", "interestingVotes": {"down": 6, "up": 26}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor \u0096 Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!", "reviewTitle": "Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2007-12-30", "titleId": "/title/tt0111161/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Bloker-1", "userId": "/user/ur9365949/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.640393619102939, "id": "/title/tt0111161/userreviews/rw1469093", "interestingVotes": {"down": 17, "up": 52}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas.

He runs away from the agency to meet this kid that made him into a pigeon. They then go through many challenges to show the agency that they are good and also stop the villain.\n\nSpies In Disguise wasn't anything special. It was an enjoyable film for families. There wasn't a lot of good family films that came out around the holidays. There was Cats but does anybody really want to go see that? There was Frozen 2 but that is almost out of theaters. This was really the only kids film that families could see over the break. There was a bunch of really good films but I wouldn't recommend those for families. I came out of the theater feeling how I thought I would feel. I had a good time watching the movie. Though my little brother next to me was getting a little board. That is probably the only problem I had with it. I think kids would get a little board in the second act. Besides that I think it was a solid family film. Although it might be a little intense for younger viewers. Although the animation was fantastic. I wonder if I should stop always saying it is good because it just looked so fluid and just good. There has been many films that look like this. The voice acting was great. They had a large cast of many talented actors. Will Smith starred and Tom Holland was the Co-Star. Besides that, all of the other actors were sort of just there. Ben Mendelsohn was the villain as normal but wasn't in the movie as much as you would think. Rashida Jones was also in it but didn't do much. This film had so much talent they didn't know what to do with all of it. It wasn't a problem, it was just something I noticed. The story besides the middle act was pretty fascinating. I didn't find my self drifting away from the story really at all.\n\nOverall, Spies In Disguise was a good family film that I would recommend to families.", "reviewTitle": "One Of The Better Kids Movies That Have Came Out In A While", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-01-06", "titleId": "/title/tt5814534/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "ElliesWonder", "userId": "/user/ur65949318/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.43850396935231345, "id": "/title/tt5814534/userreviews/rw5517144", "interestingVotes": {"up": 3}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "8/10 movie that will make you laugh and it's full of whimsical fantasy", "reviewTitle": "Eye catching", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-29", "titleId": "/title/tt5814534/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Kids_Movie_Institute", "userId": "/user/ur113639721/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.43285469338622007, "id": "/title/tt5814534/userreviews/rw5481376", "interestingVotes": {"down": 7, "up": 13}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "We loved Spies in Disguise because it's cool and funny at the same time. It follows the adventures of Lance Sterling, the world's greatest secret agent. He's on a quest to stop Robot Hand, the world's most evil villain, when he bumps into Walter, a geek who loves to make weird and wacky inventions. Everyone in the spy industry thinks that Walter is strange, and because of that, none of his inventions have actually been put into use. When he concocts a special potion that transforms Lance into a pigeon, the spy meets impossible problems that he has to solve. Along with Walter, of course. We love the idea of transforming a super-spy into a not-so-super pigeon. It also has very funny scenes. It has everything you are looking for - especially if you're looking for a spy with a sense of humour! Spike says: \"The graphics are amazing, the attention to detail is extraordinary, and I would recommend it for all ages.\" We really liked the scene where Lance and Walter jetted away on their luxurious ship. We would have loved to ride on that in real life and be as cool as them. During the movie, we also enjoyed how the relationship between Lance and Walter gradually developed, and everyone at the KMI wishes to see a sequel on screen soon!", "reviewTitle": "We loved this movie!", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-13", "titleId": "/title/tt5814534/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "calebdrums", "userId": "/user/ur104663977/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4240907950729495, "id": "/title/tt5814534/userreviews/rw5361229", "interestingVotes": {"down": 11, "up": 17}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "There is evil in our world. That's a basic, yet sad, fact of life. This movie attempts to circumvent that truth by claiming that, \"there are no good or bad guys, only people.\" That, in itself, makes this movie a bit more derisive than it should be. Oh, yes, Will Smith is fantastic as Lance Sterling, and Tom Holland portrays the awkward nerd Walter in a terrific manner. It reminded me a whole lot of his role as Spider-Man in Far From Home.\n\nThere are a lot of hilarious moments in this film. For instance, the entire scene in Mexico where Lance, as a pigeon, meets up with other pigeons who then attempt to initiate him into their group is a complete and utter riot. It's uproarious, to say the least. I also enjoyed how they did not create voices for the other birds, but rather, created characters that could be portrayed with subtle movements and simple cooing. You can tell that one of them is insane, one is dumber than a box of rocks, and the third is supposed to be some kind of attractive female pigeon.\n\nThe movie also touches on a lot of spying tropes and turns them inside out in order to create an atmosphere where a pigeon could engage in espionage. It also takes the time to focus on the bird's weak points and how that would be a hindrance to the task at hand. For instance, when Lance tries to take down a Japanese arms dealer, he fails miserably because his wings aren't as strong as his arms and hands used to be. It's an intensely clever premise, and the movie delivers a lot of action among the comedy.\n\nThe problem, again, is the message, which is horrendously stupid. The idea that just speaking with an internationally known thief and battling him with cute images of puppy dogs and kitty cats is asinine on the greatest of levels. While I appreciate the movie's efforts to advocate for humans to tone down the violence and be nicer to each other, there are times when you have to, as the movie itself puts it, \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\nSo, overall, this was a very well written, well animated feature. Blue Sky never scrimps on animation, and it definitely shows here. The overarching problem with the movie is its ridiculous message that there are no evil people in the world, just misunderstood individuals.", "reviewTitle": "Solid Film, Ridiculous Message", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-12-28", "titleId": "/title/tt5814534/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "rgkarim", "userId": "/user/ur25226117/"}, "authorRating": 7, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4171359449129176, "id": "/title/tt5814534/userreviews/rw5360369", "interestingVotes": {"down": 5, "up": 10}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "LIKES:\n\nSmooth Animation Style A More Unique Concept Funny Fun Good Pace Heartfelt Moments Music Creativity With Gadgets Action At The End\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nA Bit Over silly At Times Villain Needing A Little More Tweak Some underutilized characters The Commercial Syndrome\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nSpies in Disguise had a lot of delays and to be honest, the movie does not shatter too many things when it comes to originality or that unique energy Disney does. This does not mean the film is bad though, and in fact it's quite enjoyable. Animation wise it's clean, bringing a design that matches the fun nature of the film, with comedy and adventure around every bin. And though much of the movie is a blur, the film succeeds to expand to other audience members and get some character development going, that fits in theme with the creative approach to the spy thriller. It's true the balance to silliness does veer off at times, and the villain needs some of that time to really get the full effect, but for the most part the movie's biggest limitation is not having that Disney spark and giving too much away in the trailers. Still, this film feels like a good theater run thanks to the fun adventure and special effects, especially if you have a little ones or a group to go with. If not, then please check this out and enjoy the fun ride.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nAnimation/Action/Adventure: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0", "reviewTitle": "Disguised As Kiddy Spy Film, But These Agents Are Action Packed", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-28", "titleId": "/title/tt5814534/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "lauriekyhl", "userId": "/user/ur77267659/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4087869337780102, "id": "/title/tt5814534/userreviews/rw5356820", "interestingVotes": {"down": 8, "up": 13}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "It's a kid's movie, yet with nonstop impressive cinematic effects and hilarious one-liners that promise to entertain kids and adults alike!

HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.  And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant  scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the  modern family and modern comedy.  Great show. Period.

Shot in a \"mockumentary\" style it follows the lives of three couples who's various members are related as family members.

The dialogue is fantastic and at many points I found myself really laughing quite loudly, something which is very rare for a TV show to accomplish for me personally. The casting is also spot on with the inclusion of Ed O'Neill (the infamous Al Bundy!), Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sof\u00eda Vergara, with each actor really bringing something unique to the mix.

The show was five episodes in, so I caught up on the action online. And I must say that the acclaim is well-deserved. The show is nothing like what I'd imagined when I read about it. It is not a typical three-camera sitcom and it actually IS as gut-wrenchingly funny as people say.\n\nWith any modern TV comedy, people are going to compare it with \"Arrested Development\", which is highly regarded as one of the greatest shows ever by many. \"Modern Family\" is not quite \"A.D.\", but I can see why some people may compare the two.\n\n\"Modern Family\", like \"Arrested Development\", is a comedy about a wacky extended family that is filmed in a quasi-documentary style, similar to \"The Office\". The characters don't acknowledge the camera, but they do contribute \"talking head\" segments to supplement the action. The show is less cartoony and surreal than \"Arrested Development\" or \"30 Rock\", but the comedy can still get pretty off-the-wall.\n\nThe ensemble cast is great. There are three branches of a single family. The patriarch (Ed O'Neill) has re-married, bringing a Colombian-born wife and her son into the fold. The daughter (Julie Bowen) and her husband (Ty Burrell) have three kids. The son (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner (Eric Stonestreet) have just adopted a Vietnamese baby. The show focuses mainly on the parents and how they raise their families and interact with each other in today's society.\n\nMy favorite character is Phil (Burrell), who plays the dad who tries to be \"hip\". He means well, but he's really kind of a wimpy husband. Phil's always putting himself in awkward situations (without always realizing it) and some of his lines are hilarious. He tries so hard to be the \"cool dad\". Next I like Cameron (Stonestreet), who's gay and proud of it. He's sensible and sensitive and he has some great lines, too.\n\nAlthough I haven't really connected with the show like I have with some others (just a matter of personal style), there's no denying that \"Modern Family\" is an above-average comedy. It's written well, with humor sewn throughout the fabric of each episode, and each episode packs some laugh-out-loud moments. And I say this as someone who rarely actually bursts into audible laughter. (Occasionally, with shows like \"A.D.\" or \"30 Rock\".) This show does it, though. Phil, in particular, has me in stitches.\n\nTo give you a comparison, I'd say \"Modern Family\" is like a cross between \"The Office\" and \"Arrested Development\". Presented more like the former, with humor and content drifting more toward the latter. More grounded in reality than \"A.D.\", though, and without some of the triple-entendres and zingers.\n\nThe show finds windows to sneak in some wholesome family morals like togetherness and acceptance, but the episodes always end with a laugh.\n\nBut the rumors are true. \"Modern Family\" IS a very funny new comedy. Check it out on ABC or ABC.com if you don't believe me. (Or wherever else it's available.) It definitely should be on your radar.", "reviewTitle": "Laugh-out-loud ensemble comedy; a \"The Office\"/\"Arrested Development\" hybrid (almost...)", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2009-10-26", "titleId": "/title/tt1442437/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "alfieosullivan", "userId": "/user/ur93464914/"}, "authorRating": 2, "helpfulnessScore": 0.45726887141211986, "id": "/title/tt1442437/userreviews/rw4378580", "interestingVotes": {"down": 16, "up": 25}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This show run it's course after season 3.

You can tell because they often go back to the interview at the most weakly-written moments. This is one problem, but not the major one, with Modern Family. The aspects that disturb me the most are these: they're supposed to be modern families and there are no working mothers (do the writers misunderstand the term \"post-feminist era\"?) except for a few temporary jobs in single eps. Also there are no poor or even lower-middle-class characters. Actually, I do remember one character who was poor, but of course he was a one-time character on a Christmas episode. I'm sick of the characters whining about first-world problems like not being able to buy the \"perfect gift\" for their spouse on their birthday. What's so tragic about buying the iPad the day before or after their birthday? I realize this is a satire, but the writers don't seem to have that much contempt for the people they're satirizing. They don't seem to be TRYING to show how spoiled and self-centered many upper-middle-class are (it just comes out that way). That's not part of the satire, except maybe with the character of Haley (Sarah Hyland). Another thing that bothers me is that Claire (Julie Bowen) comes off as a lot crazier than the writers seem to intend. She's ALWAYS breathlessly freaking out, and it's more irritating than funny. In real life she's be at least an OUTpatient in some psychiatric facility. The gay couple (Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson) are gay stereotypes, especially Cameron, but since I hate political correctness and they're actually funny it doesn't bother me much. It would be nice, however, if the show did what it could to improve America's perception of gay people. Since Camoron is a prissy, whining, crying drama queen, the other character, Mitchell, could be the antithesis of a gay stereotype. The comedy could come from people thinking the character is straight. Manny's (Rico Rodriguez's) character doesn't resemble any human being on the planet. He's too cartoonish (sitcoms have always had kids who act like adults and adults who act like kids) and neither funny nor well-acted. On the positive side, Ed O'Neill is amazing as Jay Pritchett. As he was in \"Married, With Children\", he's like a comedy machine, delivering every line perfectly.

I'm only focusing the weak sides of the show so that you have some insights to understand why it isn't as good as the original and why it feels a little bit off.\n\nFirst, the things happening too fast, and the time perception is confusing. When did our main guy go from nobody to the boss of the bosses? They didn't put enough developments in order for him to turn into a boss. He just killed some people and suddenly became a Godfather. It's almost unbelievable. One minute he has all the controls, next minute some people torturing him. One minute everything's fine, next minute everybody's got a problem.\n\nSecond, the characters are lacking, or their arc isn't believable enough. For example, the main guy. He doesn't have moments. Even if he did have some small moments, it was all poorly executed. I really don't know why the writers didn't do the same thing as what they did with Pablo. We knew that that guy is the guy. He had at least one moment to shine in every episode. They even gave him enough screen time to explore his mental status. They actually managed to turn an evil man into a lovable character. When he appered in this show I lost my sh\u2757t. But now this guy, F\u00e9lix Gallardo, feels like a side character in his own story. He doesn't even have a normal human interaction. In the first episode, he said he used to be a cop, but I forgot about that until he reminded it us again in the last episode. I felt like he was in his own show because he just had to.

You know who I'm referring to: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow... the list goes on.\n\nWell, in the midst of the exuberant young career helmed by one Grace VanderWaal (who became an overnight sensation from a talent show with her uplifting lyrics, raw vocal talent and a wooden ukulele), in comes a film whose screenplay is adapted from a 20-year-old novel that hearkens closely to the livelihood of a then 15-year-old girl.\n\nGrace, much like Stargirl (and hereon out I can simply use the pronoun \"she\" to interchangeably refer to both), has a magic touch: in she comes, out she goes, and everyone is positively affected by her presence and actions. Always humbled, the cogwheels in her head turn differently where she sees light as the spark and answer to all of life's secrets, even if it means that normalcy falls into the wayside of obscurity. She lives in the moment, for the moment. She is never seeking instant gratification, and although she yearns for acceptance, she will not allow herself to be ill-fated by what others deem to groom her to be.\n\nAnd yet, this film is not even about Stargirl. We see the film through the lens of the other co-star named Leo, who spends the early parts of the film settling for what small role he can blend into in his small school in a small town, all of which are notorious for accomplishing next to nothing. Stargirl's arrival is something of a stroke of magic to some, yet thematically we can all agree that she merely taps the potential that every character instills inside of them.\n\nAs far as the movie itself goes, it's pretty decent. It held my attention, and even though it works through minimalistic plot development, it is meant to serve the characters more than anything else. Unfortunately, I think some of the character structure was a bit off with the pacing, and I think the best thing that would have saved it is if this went the way of a TV series instead. I'm fine with it being a film so long as I can feel the passage of time within a few minutes span and fill in any gaps, but otherwise this had some weird off-beat moments.\n\nAnyway, Grace really starts to disappear as Stargirl. When I first heard she was cast for the role, I thought for a while this would be one of those cutesy \"Aww look at little Grace doing her thing in a movie!\" Nope, instead she played a character (who could sing and play the uke, but that's okay) and she played it quite strongly. I was proud to see that, and would love to see her in other roles again. They don't always have to be leads and they don't have to involve music, and I would most certainly like to check it out for myself.\n\nSit back and enjoy this one, but don't expect the world of it.

But there were some where her novice acting ability was apparent. Those are few and far between. For those scenes I fault the director - I wish Ms. Hart would have used a different take on those occasions.\n\nI'm glad the movie doesn't follow the book exactly. The book was much darker, nastier, and meaner than the movie. I did miss the pebble wagon though. I thought that was an integral part of Stargirl's thought process and how she lived her life. The essence of the story remains, however.\n\nI don't understand some of the negative reviews; although the supporting characters are necessary and provide much-needed distraction, I don't feel it necessary to give them any more airtime than they got. Karan Arjun did a great job as Graham's antagonist and comes off as the better actor; that's likely due to more experience in front of the camera. The 2000 vs. 2020 comparison is sort of meaningless if you understand the true theme of the movie.\n\nWhich, in my opinion, is redemption. Without giving too much of the plot away, the penultimate scene at the Winter Ball was subtle yet historic. I can't recall any other film that expresses the love of one person for another as what Stargirl does for Leo.

Anyway, some are already complaining Stargirl here is not quirky enough. Others are saying the whole quirkiness thing is old. You can't win. In reality, it seemed a lot of the stuff that was in the book - Stargirls quirky tendencies and the students reactions to it, was simply left out. Maybe you don't like that, but it seemed to make for a less cliched movie to me, one not obsessed with typical teen bullying, mocking the outcasts, etc. Both Stargirl and everyone else seemed to be given less outrageous or more tolerant personalities. I expected Hillari Kimbell to be like a typical bully, for example. She absolutely was not, and there was so much dignity to her character. Are Hollywood's bully tropes changing?\n\nYeah, so the movie Stargirl focuses more on visuals and music rather than on encounters between Stargirl and students. In fact, Stargirl has almost no interaction at all with any students outside of Leo. Be prepared for this as I wasn't. What this means is that Stargirl's popularity and then fall from grace is expressed somewhat obliquely, through football cheers, high fives, or through Leo only. The other students are pretty much invisible as supporters or detractors (save Hillari) And is football your only road to popularity in high school? Good question. In some schools, football is still God, I suppose.\n\nOK, but now on to the love story which dominated the film more than I expected. Leo's backstory was a bit cheesy, but maybe I'm not a porcupine tie kind of guy. Thats OK - otherwise, I very much appreciated his character and how he was grounded in reality unlike Stargirl who's idealism made her prone to making occasional errors in judgement. And Stargirl - this was singer songwriter Grace VanderWaal's film debut - she was wonderful. The vast majority of her time on screen she is engaging, smart, buoyant and childlike in her joy, or just plain mesmerizing. And somehow her pet rat Cinnamon comes to embody her adorable qualities as you will see in one particular early scene. Later, she changes somewhat and you see her sadness and loneliness, as well as stubborn insistence on being herself. At times, it was compelling. Overall, the love story blossomed nicely (after an improbable start (a little too much of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl coming out of nowhere) and both Leo and Stargirl are given plenty of screen time.\n\nFinally, the movie for me peaks midway through as we delve more deeply into Stargirls character and her vulnerabilities are exposed. She tries to conform, but never really shows she knows how to make friends (showing her actually trying to do this might have been good, BTW), something she says she wanted to do. That was sad - I know the experience. It is actually a trait common in autistic people, and possibly Stargirl might have been on the spectrum. So, but this is what made the ending appropriate but also a bit unsatisfying, because she never really got to know any of the people she was dancing with so gleefully. I guess they saw her as a somewhat mystical power rather than a friend. It was a little kooky though, and it seemed there were some words that where left unsaid or a little awkwardly expressed perhaps.\n\nOverall, in conclusion much of this movie I didn't expect, but in a good way. In talking about it, I bring up the occasional negatives, but in reality i loved most of it. And what are the lasting effects likely to be on Stargirl after her experience at Mica? I doubt she will remember anyone there besides Leo, and what did she take away from that relationship? Hopefully we will find out in a sequel. But I think Leo did teach her a little about the benefits of conforming - it makes the world go a little smoother at times. Its funny, because the movie is suppose to be all about being yourself, but does Stargirl FEAR conforming as it would cause her to lose herself in other people? Would that scare her? These questions and themes were never really explored and they might have been also. Its food for thought.\n\nOh yeah - I almost forgot - I'm all for cell phones and social media, but is the future of movies going to involve actors and actresses spending a lot of time staring down at their devices???

I also think Karan might have a good future career. So, I even found and read the book on which the film is based. The book was ok, although I don't understand its popularity - there are much, much better books for children and teens, that have more substance, more depth and less cliches. Perhaps young teens who haven't been exposed to any better literature enjoy it, and that's fine.\n\nBut no matter how much I wanted Grace's debut to be a success, I can't lie to myself or others - it's a really, really badly made film. Being a filmmaker myself, it almost makes me angry that someone actually got paid for directing and producing it. I mean, for someone who has all these resources to produce a result like this is mind-boggling. If I hadn't read the book, I don't think I'd even fully understand what was going on.\n\nIt's like they completely disregarded all of the emotional impact of the events in the book, all of the buildup, and just skimmed though a series of events for the sake of putting them on screen. Aside from her meticulously designed colorful outfits, you get zero sense of how quirky Stargirl is (the most important trait of her character), how involved the guys are in the talk show that they're hosting, and basically anything else that's supposed to matter. It's like they weren't even trying to create an emotional connection to any of the characters, because not one of them is even remotely interesting.\n\nAnother huge problem with the film is the sound design. I'm not sure why it is like it is, but it's bad. It's flat, the actor's lines are mumbled, and there are very little atmosphere sounds. This makes for very awkward viewing.\n\nLastly, I doubt that young people will like the film, except for maybe very young teens or children (but even they probably won't have the patience to watch it till the end because it's so emotionally flat). This is because no teens are the way they are portrayed in the film. It feels like a really old person's vague idea of how teenagers talk and behave. There's one place in particular that made me snort loudly, it was when Leo asked Archie \"is she magic?\" It was so completely random and silly, mostly because, like I mentioned before, there was zero sense of Stargirl's quirkiness or the profound impact she'd made on everyone. It's not completely unrealistic that a 16 year-old guy would as a question like this, but there should be a really, really good reason for it and a serious buildup to the moment where he asks it. Here, it was like: wait, what?\n\nLastly, for anyone who's looking for a film on a similar topic, I suggest to skip Stargirl and watch \"Bridge to Terabithia\" (2007) instead. Very similar story, but a much, much more engaging film that will be enjoyed by children and adults alike.", "reviewTitle": "An awkward, badly made film", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-03-14", "titleId": "/title/tt4858674/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "redsox-62548", "userId": "/user/ur70974543/"}, "authorRating": 4, "helpfulnessScore": 0.31267423686570306, "id": "/title/tt4858674/userreviews/rw5554425", "interestingVotes": {"down": 4, "up": 6}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I get it, girl helps boy to become who he should be and to be open and who he wants but the whole movie just seemed pointless and bland", "reviewTitle": "Just never hit the point", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2020-03-16", "titleId": "/title/tt4858674/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "devonleighjohnson", "userId": "/user/ur86209875/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.30466046466297936, "id": "/title/tt4858674/userreviews/rw5549897", "interestingVotes": {"down": 19, "up": 16}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Why must we indulge the manic pixie dream girl trope in the year of our lord, 2020, and worse yet, pilfer it upon the new generation?

If I had to think of one word to describe this movie that word would be 'nice'. This is a nice movie. If it has a failing at all, it is that it is sometimes too nice and you wish for a bit of tension or conflict to liven things up, and eventually that does come but not until well into the movie. At least you know that you can safely allow your family members of any age to watch this, knowing there is no swearing, no sex (other than a couple of kisses) and nothing controversial. There aren't even any attempts at diversity. This movie doesn't feature a multi racial couple or any gay character, if these things matter too you. This movie may even present opportunities to have family discussions about such things as fitting in, peer pressure, self confidence and so on.\n\nGrace Vanderwaal plays the eponymous Stargirl and is quite charming. You may think she looks sort of familiar, as I did. Then I remembered she was on America's Got Talent, singing and playing the ukelele. Graham Vercheere plays the teenage boy who is firstly intrigued and then captivated by Stargirl. He is very likeable too. In fact, the whole cast is likable and act well.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a girl named Stargirl, a quirky, very individual girl who sees no need to fit in or live up to other's expectations and so doesn't try to. Young Leo is enchanted by her. Unusually, for any teen movie, Stargirl's individuality does not get her ostracised, bullied or picked on. Quite the opposite in fact. Her whole school embraces her and her idiosyncrasies. She is 'flavour of the month' until she makes several social faux pas and draws the ire of the other students upon her. There are a couple of barely credible song and dance numbers where Grace leads the school and cheer squad while performing on her ukelele. Yes, her ukelele. I chuckled too. The acoustics on the school football field must be amazing! In fact, that is one other small failing in this movie: it threatens several times to slip into full blown into 'High School Musical' mode. The musical scenes are enjoyable, but I am not 100 percent sure they contribute much to the story. Never mind. There is certainly a moral to this movie, a life-lesson, if you will, but I'm not really sure what it is.\n\nIMDB has posited that this might be the next big young adult phenomenon. Personally, I can't see that happening. I can't really see how this can have a sequel to begin with, but never underestimate Hollywood's desire to make a buck.

The battle was a key inflection point in World War II, perhaps the pivotal moment changing the course of the Pacific War.\n\nAlthough I loved seeing Henry Fonda as Nimitz in the 1976 version of \"Midway\" (Fonda was to play Nimitz in \"In Harms Way\" as well), unfortunately, I found that movie to be surprisingly dull, historically inaccurate, unnecessarily melodramatic, and generally not very good.\n\nBecause my experience is that more recent movie renderings of historical subjects usually don't improve the historical accuracy (I'm thinking of 2001's God-awful Ben Affleck \"Pearl Harbor\" vis-\u00e0-vis 1970's \"Tora Tora Tora\"), I did not have high hopes for this new \"Midway.\"\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIn short, \"Midway\" is a terrific movie. Not only does it get the history (mostly) right, it's a tight, elegant, and superb rendering that does the historical figures proud. It succeeds to pack way more into its 2 hour, 18 minute run length than you can imagine. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, the PACFLT-Washington tension & dynamic, Nimitz's ascension to command of the Pacific, LCDR Layton's contribution to the intelligence picture, Joe Rochefort's robe-wearing genius, Yamamoto's soul-searching, Halsey's tenacity, the ascendency of naval aviation, a tiny bit of the submarine contributions to the battle, and-oh yeah-the actual battle itself, to include the incredible, unbelievable jaw-dropping (but true!) heroism of our Yorktown and Enterprise naval aviators. And it does all this justice, in a superb bit of moviemaking.\n\nCan a 26-year Navy veteran like me find nits to pick on? Of course: \n* I saw a few collar devices that weren't pinned on right (I'm talking about you, Layton!)\n* At least one scene that is historical legend but didn't really happen\n* The substantially underrepresented submarine role in the battle (being a submariner, perhaps my biggest regret)\n* Some Annapolis grads wearing their class ring on the wrong hand (tradition has us wearing our rings on our left hand, not the right)\n* Sailors not \"squaring away\" their Dixie cup hats the way they would have back then\n* I wish the Pearl Harbor officers' club was as nice as they portrayed it in the movie!\n* They placed a non-existent cemetery on Pearl Harbor's Hospital Point\n* Kimmel didn't watch the attack from the Pacific Fleet headquarters, he watched it from his office on the Pearl Harbor submarine base (which later became my office and is on the national register of historic places)\n* They would not have worn their service dress khaki in the Officer's Club-- they would have worn service dress whites (chokers)\n* The band in the O-club would have been locals not sailors (they missed an opportunity to have somebody like Gabby Pahinui playing!)\n\n\nBut the good stuff way exceeds the nits: \n* They got the Pacific Fleet headquarters right-- it's not the Pearl Harbor shipyard commander's building\n* They got the torpedo failures right-- torpedoes were terrible early in the war\n* They got the Yorktown repair in 48 hours in Drydock 4 in the Pearl Harbor shipyard right-- the shipyard rendering was near perfect\n* They got the code breaking room in the basement of the PACFLT headquarters right (when I was stationed there the room was being used to store furniture and I petitioned to get it on the national register of historic places)\n* It might have been a lot of CGI, but it was really good CGI. They rendered Pearl Harbor almost perfectly. I could even make out my Ford Island house from my time as commodore, as well as a historically accurate rendering of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, the Pearl Harbor submarine base, and of course, the ships and planes.\n* Something I never thought I'd hear myself say: Woody Harrelson was superb as Nimitz. He's no Fonda, but he was understated and believable, the way I've always seen Nimitz in my mind. Not a casting idea I would have thought of, but it worked!\n* Except for the collar device issue listed above, the uniforms were exactly right for the period, from the flat shoulder boards that were being used in that era, to the beaten-up look the ship's laundry would have given Service Dress Khaki, to the way the sailors were dressed, to the way the pilots wore their wings, etc.\n* It even brought out the fact that movie director John Ford was on Midway doing a documentary when the battle went down. The fact that Ford volunteered for the Navy, saw battle, and was injured, while John Wayne remained (in his mind) safely at home, become a point of tension between the two men, with Ford being one of the few who felt comfortable belittling Wayne for his lack of service as the years went by.\n* I really liked the outtro mini-bios of the real characters at the end. I didn't learn anything new there, but thought they were extremely well done.\n\n\nIn the end the 2+ hours flew by for me. It was so good, I plan on seeing it again next weekend. What a terrific way to celebrate Veteran's Day.\n\nOf course, Roland Emmerich's prior movies have been, on the whole, simpleminded blockbusters. But this time he took a risk by doing something thoughtful, respectful, accurate, and artistic. The only way to ensure movies like this continue to be made is for the public to show we care about history and accuracy, and to make this movie a success. I very much hope it does well. Then maybe we have a chance of getting the right movie made about the Indianapolis.\n\nA final thought: I've been disgusted by many of the cynical, snarky reviews written by professional movie reviewers, many of which sneer at the bravery of the warriors depicted. Yes, the dialog in this movie is sometimes simple, tired, and trite. A few of the characters are not well developed, particularly the women. It's perfectly appropriate for reviewers to criticize elements of moviemaking. One reviewer made fun of the line of dialog where Best says \"This is for Pearl Harbor.\" There is nothing silly or unreasonable about that line. You can bet one of the pilots actually said something like that that day. As somebody who survived 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, when I later went to Afghanistan, you can bet if I had the chance to do so I would have said, \"This is for Gerry DeConto,\" one of my friends who didn't make it out that day. But many these sneering reviewers have gone on to say to readers that because of these weaknesses, they should not see \"Midway.\" Keep in mind that there were similar elements of Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" that could be considered inaccurate and/or over-the-top movie-making (most of the scenes depicted in Congress, for example), but on the whole the events portrayed in that movie are important for Americans to understand. Same is true here. So the point I want to make is this: a movie can have elements of poor moviemaking, and yet be an important movie for viewers to watch. \"Midway\" is one such movie. It depicts a poorly understood event in American history, but one that Americans should be exposed to. The events depicted, and the people depicted, are real. They really did these things. The bravery was real. Americans need to know this, and reviewers who have likely never risked anything in their lives should have the good graces not to sneer at those who have.", "reviewTitle": "10 Stars from 26-year Navy veteran", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-11-10", "titleId": "/title/tt6924650/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "3xHCCH", "userId": "/user/ur4294858/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7300798114218429, "id": "/title/tt6924650/userreviews/rw5220617", "interestingVotes": {"down": 108, "up": 362}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.\n\nAlong the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).\n\nThe side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.\n\nThe execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us \"Independence Day\" (1996) and \"2012\" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.\n\nFor its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in \"Midway.\" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first \"Midway\" film or \"Pearl Harbor.\" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible.

The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.\n\nWhile no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.\n\nI went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.\n\nThe Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.\n\nThe accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.\n\nAbout the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused.

The Kamikaze hit on Enterprise during that battle (complete with Nick Jonas saving the day) never took place. The complete absence of American fighter planes on the American carriers. American attackers going in and facing anti aircraft fire without having first been jumped by Zeroes, and the missing dogfights via F4F fighter escorts. SBDs blowing Zeros out of the sky. Taking the time to depict John Ford as a brave movie maker on Midway, yet not showing Marine Fighter Squadron 221, flying antiquated equipment, going out to meet the incoming Japanese attackers against overwhelming odds and pretty much getting slaughtered.

I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money. I made the rare exception this weekend to see \"Midway\", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations. Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with. Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid. All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy. The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, \"Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style.\" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in \"Midway\" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing. I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway?

So many that only those already familiar with the battles will be able to spot them all.\n\nAlthough I am a former Naval Aviator, kudos to the writers to giving the Marine Aviators and Army Air Corps their due credit in the battle of Midway, something the 1976 movie neglected. Only one minor disappointment in that the sacrifice of the three American Torpedo Bombing squadrons was underplayed.\n\nI suspect those not familiar with history will not be able to keep up with all the details portrayed, but outstanding job by Roland Emmerich for even trying.\n\nPS. To the dude below about the glaring historical accuracy, you are correct. Midway was reinforced with a detachment of B-26 bombers armed with torpedoes. One of the did make a suicide run at IJN Akagi, which prompted Admiral Nagumo to prepare for a second air attack on Midway Island, only to reverse his decision when one of his cruiser's scout plane's spotted one of the American task forces, all of which contributed to ordnance to be stacked all over the Akagi's hanger bay when LT Richard Best's single bomb detonated inside the Akagi, causing an inferno that doomed the ship.", "reviewTitle": "Awesome Attention To Historical Detail", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-11-09", "titleId": "/title/tt6924650/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "bartdereu", "userId": "/user/ur23773712/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5388103618167697, "id": "/title/tt6924650/userreviews/rw5380845", "interestingVotes": {"down": 38, "up": 66}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "All i can say is this : it's typical when an american history story is put into a movie it gets descent scores.

It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.\n\nWhat MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.\n\nBefore I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.\n\nThat said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.\n\nCredit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)\n\nDirector Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level.", "reviewTitle": "A commendable effort but needs a longer directors cut - RELEASE IT PLEASE", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-11-08", "titleId": "/title/tt6924650/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "jrougeux-71286", "userId": "/user/ur110058437/"}, "authorRating": 6, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5306003912649023, "id": "/title/tt6924650/userreviews/rw5261938", "interestingVotes": {"down": 38, "up": 64}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Overdone special effects.

Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.\n\nWhile Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.\n\nIn the new film \"Midway\" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant. Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.\n\nThe U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy. Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.\n\nWith a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.\n\nThe film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.\n\nThe film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.\n\nThe film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.\n\n4.5 stars out of 5", "reviewTitle": "A Solid War Movie That Puts Characters Over FX", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-11-06", "titleId": "/title/tt6924650/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "phd_travel", "userId": "/user/ur22484170/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5196761173307156, "id": "/title/tt6924650/userreviews/rw5240983", "interestingVotes": {"down": 84, "up": 120}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling.

This is my favorite show and I have memorized every episode. So, let's get started! This show is simple- it is, to put it in concise terms, a series of events happening between episodes 2 and 3 of the prequels.  This show shows the progression of how the writers and animators weren't afraid to try new things after a while.  Season 1 of this show is sort of dull. As I said, the creators weren't very brave at this point, and didn't really know what crossed the line. Soon, of course, they found out: THERE IS NO LINE. There are a few good episodes in the season, getting better as it comes to a close. But overall, it was just flashy lights and big noises- your typical kid's show.  Season 2 is where they started accelerating, in terms of creativity. They made their first four-episode story arc, and made some pretty darn good standalones. \"Cat and Mouse\" was a particular favorite of mine. Season 3 is where they really started putting some good stuff into the show. There was a lot more commentary, and the show got pretty intellectual and actually got older audiences thinking. The last few episodes of the season are where they really show their transition. The animators changed their style, and a lot of things changed, but I loved the change in the Jedi's clothing style and the beginning of this new, smarter, creative show that the people behind this masterpiece had just started. Season 4 is where it gets great. What surprised me was the amount of violence. Clone Wars was no longer a show for seven year olds. Now it was a show for twelve and thirteen year olds, and for the parents watching too. They came up with some great stories, including \"Obi-Wan goes undercover,\" \"Water Wars\", \"General Krell,\" and of course, the revival of Darth frickin' Maul. That's right. They bring back Darth Maul.  Anyway, Season 5 was all four-part arcs. (On the DVD version, Revival is right before Shades of Reason.) These were very interesting stories. The first arc, for example, is a strange meld of the American Revolution and the Vietnam War, as Jedi go to train people on another planet, who are looking to overthrow their tyrant ruler, King Rash. Sometimes, the arcs get too lighthearted (Like the one with R2-D2 and the frog colonel) but overall it was a good season, with an astonishingly beautiful, sad, and open ending. Season 6 is where they just went nuts. Clone Wars was not on TV anymore, so they could do whatever they wanted. And the episodes in Season 6 went from Fives investigating something in the genetic code of the clones, to Anakin and Obi-Wan looking for clues as to the mysterious death of Sifo-Dyas. Great season.  Anyway, \n\nAnimation: Sort of lazy and generic at the start, but it sure got better. 18/20\n\nPlots: Started off bland, but got interesting very fast. 19/20\n\nCharacters: Fleshed out over time, they were actually given real development. 19/20\n\nSoundtracks: At first, they were all very similar, and then they made themes, and started using an orchestra and made some music very satisfying for the  ears. 18/20\n\nVoice Acting: Good. 17/20\n\nOverall rating: 91%", "reviewTitle": "Pretty darn good for a \"kid's show\"", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2018-08-29", "titleId": "/title/tt0458290/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "mto10", "userId": "/user/ur50042013/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.7247594341307457, "id": "/title/tt0458290/userreviews/rw4593228", "interestingVotes": {"down": 8, "up": 44}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Taking place between Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith; The Clone Wars highlights the war between the Republic and Separatists.

It balances the goofy moments you can find in Star Wars, and animation in general, with serious moments. Also, it gets progressively darker as the show continues. Most of all, it actually makes The Clone Wars interesting. This series could've easily fell into a trap similar to one that the new trilogy is in, but it's completely fresh, and a great expansion to the Star Wars lore. It gives more development to characters from the prequel trilogy; such as Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padm\u00e9, etc. And introduces new characters, that you'll grow to love just as much, mainly Ahsoka and Rex. The Clone Wars also gives the villains some more time to shine; with General Grievous, Count Dooku, Palpatine, and another returning Sith being prominently featured.\n\nOverall, the show is a great addition to the Star Wars universe.

Episodes 4 & 5 are even better, and as a listener to the podcasts on theforce.net the interviews are brilliant too. The creators are aware of what we like and don't and they reassure us not to worry, as some very cool stuff is still in the pipeline. \n\nI even rewatched the clone wars movie again now its out on DVD and i like it 10 times better than i did before. I guess everything was new. I also found out that the movie was the first stuff they filmed for the series and that everything that has come since has been improved upon, and much has yet to be seen.

So far i'm loving it, and cant wait for each episode. Finally, some of us may actually understand what GL was trying to achieve with the prequels. The kids love it too. I hope it gets a little darker though, or at least remains at the level of the malevolence storyline. \n\nCant wait for the LIVE ACTION show next year too, but I hope that one is gonna be dark and for the fans, and not for the kids.

People keep missing it and viewing figures will drop, and its the show that will get the blame yet its because its hardly aired consistently. This has happened with LOST and other great TV.

I've always loved the Star Wars films, but until recently had avoided the animated side of things for fear that they'd be too childlike or not of terribly great quality. Watching The Clone Wars Movie didn't do much to allay my fears, although the animation was impressive the rest of the quality was questionable, to say the least.\n\nNonetheless I dived into watching the Clone Wars, the TV Series, and have found myself increasingly impressed & eager to watch more. The first couple of seasons were a little more child-orientated, but the plot quickly turns surprisingly dark & more fitting to the rest of the Star Wars canon.\n\nI think this series does a remarkable job of building up characters and filling in gaps that were rather obvious between the films. The number one example is Anakin, whose character changed drastically between the films without much detail to fill in why he'd changed so much, what drove that, etc. This series does an absolutely brilliant job of explaining Anakin, and delving deeper into his character, and shows the side of Anakin, the 'light' side that we didn't get to see much of in the films. The creation/inclusion of his Padawan, Ahsoka, was a touch of genius & Ahsoka becomes more central to the plot over time.\n\nYou end up largely forgetting this series in an animation, such is the quality of the dialogue, plot lines & the level of detail sunk into almost every episode. The animation itself is beautifully done as well, and perhaps allowed a level of stunt work & lightsaber duelling that the films couldn't, not to mention the semi-regular, detailed, vivid space combat.\n\nFrom being very cautious going into this series, I've come out the other side a little amazed, and I find myself wanting to go back and re-watch the series from the start in case I missed any little bits and pieces.

Though I have a season to get through still, I feel like I can give it a legit review.\n\nFor those who are wondering what the show is about, it documents the time period between Episode 2 and Episode 3. I didn't really like any of the prequels, but I decided to take a chance on this series. I'm glad I did because it tied together a lot of loose ends and things I had wondered about. It's also 10 x better than any of the prequel movies, I kid you not.\n\nA lot of this series is about Clones fighting Droids as well as Obi Wan Kenobi vs. General Grievous and Dooku, BUT it extends to much beyond that. It gives us an inside look at the inner workings of the Jedi Council, it shows us a TON about Darth Sidious and Count Dooku (which actually make them interesting), and it shows us a bunch about Anakin that we never knew. Come to find out Dooku had several sith apprentices, Anakin had a padawan, Darth Maul was still alive (wtf!), and there's a lot more to the clones than meets the eye. We also actually see Senator Amidala have a poignant and important role in the republic (more than just being a love interest like in the films). Just a warning, if you watch this show, you might actually hate the prequels even MORE because of the lack of detail and depth in comparison to this cartoon.\n\nTHE ANIMATION: The first couple of episodes, I wasn't sold on it. It does look a BIT cheesy, but once you get used to it, you'll like it. They are able to do so much more with the series being animated and you'll come to appreciate that. Also, some may be concerned that its a kids show? Sure it is kid friendly, but it also shows plenty of grown up action. You'll be plenty satisfied with the content unless you're some kind of weirdo.\n\nTHE ACTION: Great level of action in the series. Plenty of blaster fights and most importantly lightsaber duels. The lightsaber duels are impressive and frequent in this series. You'll see The Chancellor square off with Darth Maul, Anakin fight Dooku, Obi Wan fight Grievious, etc.\n\nTHE ACTING: It's animated so you have to go off of voices. The voice acting is excellent! Every voice is imitated to a TEE. From Mace Windu to Chancellor Palpatine, the voicing is on point. If you didn't know better, you'd think Obi Wan was still played by Ewan McGregor! THE PLOT: The TV series can do what the movies can NOT; go into greater detail. If you are into Star Wars like I am, you'll find this series to be a nerdgasm of info. The series also shows you a ton of alien races and details their \"cultures.\" It's pretty interesting because you see a lot of these aliens come up in the movies.\n\nThe one thing that bothers me about the show is that it can linger on a particular subject for too long. I just finished watching a 4 episode run about four droids and an alien who steal a device from the Seperatists. It was pretty damn boring and I regret watching all of it. Just keep in mind that every season there are probably 3 or 4 throw away episodes that just SUCK. Feel free to skim the plots online instead of watching those episodes. For that reason, I have to dock two points. Otherwise it's a darn good show! Watch it!

I loved the animation design of the whole atmosphere of the galaxy and the design of all the characters. It was colorful and very creative just like you'd see in every Star Wars movie. I also enjoyed the voice acting even though most of the main actors in the live action movies never returned. The dialogue at sometimes was a bit cheesy at times and the way some of the droids talked was just plain stupid and it could annoy many fans. Besides that though the other actors are very good voice actors.\n\nThe things I was not impressed with the series is how the great John Williams didn't return to do the music and also I found the plot outline a bit weak. Without John Williams, fans will recognize changes in the music that are not anything like the music you'd hear in any of the 6 Star Wars films.

I know nothing of this trouble! Look forward to our meeting soon I do.\" Yoda Yes there will be plenty of spoilers in this review, but if you're familiar with even the basic tenets of this remarkable TV series read on, because I am going to be completely honest and very candid in my remarks. Fortunately my being candid will work out in the positive because I absolutely love this TV series to death.\n\nLet me start off by saying I am absolutely a Star Wars NUT! I love practically anything and everything related to Star Wars, it's a fun, funny, fast paced, and clean universe that George Lucas assisted in creating. I grew up on Star Wars. (I was born in the early 90's) and my childhood memories are filled with watching the original trilogy in with all the special effects and reenacting lightsaber duels and battles from all 6 of the movies. Basically i can't get enough Star Wars.\n\nNow, onto the premise. It's the Clone Wars, and it's a tumultuous time for the Star Wars Galaxy. It's the Republic vs the Confederation and the Jedi code and Jedi tenets are being pushed to the breaking point while an insidious Palpatine commandeers and rules both sides of the conflict in the limelight and in the shadows with his sith apprenrice, Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus leading the confederation. Obi Wan Kenobi is now on the Jedi High Council and Anakin Skywalker has taken an apprentice, a Tugruta named Ahsoka Tano.\n\nAs is to be expected we see a lot of Obi Wan, Anakin and Ahsoka. In fact it could be argued that to a large degree The Clone Wars is in a way Ahsoka's series. This makes sense because Anakin and Obi-Wan's stories have already been covered and explored in depth through the other movies and novels published. We also see some recurring appearances of famous jedi such as Mace Windu, Yoda, Kit Fisto, and we even get to see that scumbag General Grievous who is really a butthurt buffoon who took a jedi withdrawal way too personally for my taste and is now one of the Galaxy's most notorious jedi killers, makes a lot of sense doesn't it? NOT! I like how the episodes are short and sweet and generally straight to the point. The recaps show some cool stuff and the graphics are amazing with a great soundtrack to back up what is already an amazing show. 2 of my complaints about the show, (and what stopped it from getting a perfect 10) are the narration voice is way over the top and at times highly annoying, and i was really disappointed with the ending. I felt so bad for Ahsoka and the arrogance of members of the Jedi Council, specifically Plo Koon and Mace Windu completely floored me. HOW COULD THEY BE SO STUPID? Ugh it rattles me to see such arrogance. Not to mention such a sad ending was kind of depressing in my books but hey i guess they had to do what they had to do.\n\nDon't be fooled however, this is a FANTASTIC TV series! Seriously if i could only come up with 2 things wrong with this series and everything else is right then that is INCREDIBLE! I loved particularly how the first episode is all about Yoda and the clones (you can't go wrong starting with Yoda). The lightsaber duels and lightsaber action is just amazing you can tell that the creators and makers of this show put a lot of time and effort into the combat sequences. I loved in particular how there were very few episodes that didn't have at least some lightsaber action. After all, that's what the majority of people go to see at a Star Wars movie right? The big awesome lightsaber fight at the end? Yeah me too.\n\nI also want to point out that I'm turning 24 here in a couple of months and yet I was never more emotionally invested or responsive to a TV series than i was to The Clone Wars. For some reason the fight between Count Dooku and the nightsisters is one of my favorite duels, the camera shot where they zoom in on a kneeling Dooku and him igniting his lightsaber is just epic in my opinion. Dooku truly was a gifted duelist, one of the best in my opinion for his day and age, and i wonder what it would have been like to see him in his prime instead of him being an old man at 70+ years old. Another favorite instance of mine is when Grievous absolutely gets his butt handed to him by the Gungans. Take that you arrogant cyborg! I almost literally jumped for joy out of my chair when i saw this scene. What made it all the more awesome is that there were no lightsabers on the Gungans army side, they just had electrical grenades of some sort and electric spears. Oh man that fight was so satisfying. Seeing Darth Maul come back and his brother Savage Oppress was an awesome addition to what was already an awesome TV show. The duel between Sidious, Maul and Oppress sent chills down my spine when i saw just how epic of a duelist Sidious was. I didn't even know Sidious knew Jar Kai! The duel between Obi Wan and Maul and Oppress in the cave where Obi Wan duel wields lightsabers and just picks apart Maul and Oppress had me speechless as i watched in shock at how epic of a duelist Obi Wan was as well.\n\nThe great thing about Star Wars is it's clean. No garbage to worry about. Check this series out! It is awesome!", "reviewTitle": "An Incredible TV Series", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2014-04-21", "titleId": "/title/tt0458290/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "johnrider-55139", "userId": "/user/ur110089127/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.4092760444672076, "id": "/title/tt0458290/userreviews/rw5478518", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 6}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Here is a full analysis of the show season by season.\n\nSeason 1: Extremely underwhelming start for a show I've heard so much about. The animation is pretty good for a TV show, but that's about it. The episodes are very straightforward, have no real consequences, and more often than not seem to be like moral anecdotes for kids. Very disappointing. Rating: 5.0/10\n\nSeason 2: Definitely some improvement but still a long way from anything \"good\". It is still standalone episodes, very repetitive, and apart from a little better world exploration, the show seems to be headed nowhere. Rating: 6.5/10\n\nSeason 3: All of a sudden, the show entirely changes its tone. This is no longer a kids show, more like PG-13. The animation also improves greatly. From episode 1, we are given a much more compelling narrative. It's no longer standalone episodes, we now have story arcs. Longer arcs means more time to develop the story, added depth to characters, and much more in-depth world building. This show finally seems to be going somewhere. Rating: 8.0/10\n\nSeason 4: This is where the show becomes just amazing. We feel The Revenge of The Sith gradually being set up. The stories are getting darker and grittier. What's best is the narrative is no longer black and white. We are shown the war from the perspectives of those we have so far only called \"villains\". Rating: 9.0/10\n\nSeason 5: Another amazing season. Like I said, after season 4 the show reaches a very high standard and stays there. Although there are some boring arcs, the main story fully compensates for it. I will not go into too much detail, in fear of spoilers. Rating: 9.5/10\n\nSeason 6: Slightly, only slightly, worse than season 5, which for me is the absolute peak of this show. It still has its fair share of good story arcs and sets up many events of Episode 3. Rating: 9.0/10\n\nThoughts: An amazing show which I would recommend everyone to watch. However, if you have less time/patience, I'd suggest skipping the first 2 seasons, and soke arcs of the coming seasons (just check the episode ratings to know). This show is a great filler that takes place between the events of episode 2 and episode 3 of the prequel films. It adds so much more relevance to the events of episode 3. Viewers' biggest problem with episode 3 was how it felt rushed. Just watch Clone Wars and it will all seem to fit in place.\n\nSalient Features: 1. Humanising the Clones: The films did little justice to the clones, who were treated quite like droids with the exception of Obi Wan and Anakin. This show shows their human side, their psychology during the war, and adds uniqueness to each clone.\n\n2. Ahsoka: I will not say much to keep this review free of spoilers. All I can say is, Ahsoka's character development is at par with some of the best I've ever seen. It's a real pleasure seeing her grow from a unbalanced padawan to a well trained Jedi Commander.\n\n3. Dark side: This show also portrays the war from the perspective of the siths, somewhat humanising them, and giving us more clarity as to their decisions.\n\n4. Bounty Hunting: Even the bounty hunters aren't two dimensional characters who only care for their bounty. The show portrays bounty hunting as a respectable job, and displays the code of honour which exists between them.\n\nTL;DR: The show is a solid 10/10 for me, and a worthy addition to the Star Wars Saga. A must watch for all Star Wars fans.", "reviewTitle": "The True Essence of Star Wars Captured", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2020-02-12", "titleId": "/title/tt0458290/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "starhorsepax", "userId": "/user/ur55636117/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.39677869261194887, "id": "/title/tt0458290/userreviews/rw3099050", "interestingVotes": {"down": 3, "up": 7}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "There are only 2 kinds of episodes in my mind: The ones I liked and the ones I had to be in the mood for.\n\nI'll start with why I only gave it 8 out of 10.\n\n1. The first season being out of order was very confusing to keep up with. 2. The way they aired them one got tired of certain styles: for instance, a couple of weeks with the droids before you get back to the war. Whereas if they'd done a week of droids, skipped to the war or the politicians and so on, the variety would always have been fresh. 3. The way they ignored or killed beloved Expanded Universe stories. This didn't happen often but when it did..ugh. (Example: what did they do to Quinlan Vos?! And what they did to Evan Piell was a conflict with an ending written in a very popular story. Besides which, one episode for Evan Piell was far too little.)\n\nWhy I gave it the 8:\n\n1. I loved seeing Anakin Skywaker and Obi-Wan as heroes and friends. Also we see how that heroism of Anakin's can be twisted when those he loves are at risk. 2. I loved seeing Ahsoka Tano grow, and how that relationship affected both Anakin and Padme. 3. I loved seeing the various Jedi in action. 4. I even liked the ones with Bail Organa and Padme, because it gave a bit more to them than we see in the movies. Since Organa helped form the Rebellion, this is good stuff. 5. The animation was excellent and kept improving. 6. The stories were widely varied with something for everyone. Scary? Got it. Mystery? Got it. Western style bounty huntings, assassinations, pure war stories...got it. All of it. Funny stuff: Got Jar Jar and the droids (this comes under 'in the mood for' for me.) 7. We saw all kinds of worlds and ships and environments.\n\nThis show was at it's peak when Disney cancelled it. I think this is a real tragedy as it was just moving toward meeting up with Revenge of the Sith, and we would see Anakin becoming more disillusioned with the Jedi and how the various characters influenced that, for better or worse. The way it ends in Season 5 (and I won't say) is a guarantee that he was in for some tough times.", "reviewTitle": "A widely varied look into the Clone Wars era", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2014-10-05", "titleId": "/title/tt0458290/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "tlso1987", "userId": "/user/ur21282861/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.38619082871325483, "id": "/title/tt0458290/userreviews/rw2210307", "interestingVotes": {"down": 7, "up": 11}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "What can I say?

However, when it comes to the Expanded Universe, I'm not nearly as enthusiastic as its big brothers though there are lots of action-packed and character-driven stories to be found in between. In this case, The Clone Wars (not to be confused with Genndy Tartakovsky's brilliant 2D Clone Wars microseries) chronicles not only the major war itself but rather the journey of all the characters, both minor and major which Lucas hasn't had time to develop in the movies.\n\nWhen it comes to the recent abomination that is the Clone Wars animated series (it's basically three pilot episodes combined into one), there's a greater fear that George has once again mangled with things he shouldn't have thought of: many fans will believe that it would set a bad impression on the upcoming TV series in terms of how awful and upsetting the movie has been during its run at multiplexes (of course, I haven't watched it but I have the impression that it'll be just as notorious as the Holiday Special). So, now that the new series, under the steady hands of Avatar director Dave Filoni, has made its TV debut a few days ago: what's my verdict for the first two episodes? Surprisingly, despite some minor quibbles, they turn out to be much better and more polished than expected, thanks to good (if not spectacular) storytelling and light-hearted (sometimes serious) tone of the show.\n\nAnimation wise, the characters are inspired by the models from Thunderbirds, so there's no doubt they look like stiff puppets without strings. However, there are some compliments to be made from the animators at Singapore to make them slightly more believable in terms of facial expressions (maybe not as realistic as Pixar's but hey, it's just a TV show and for me, it's already pretty darned impressive), further enhanced by brilliant voice acting, oddly ou-of-place but beautifully orchestrated soundtrack (a good thing since I've been extremely tired of synthesized music these days) and the usual Star Wars-esquire sound effects. Perhaps one of the show's most astonishing features is characterization: here, we dwell deeper into the actual heart of characters (which I admit is missing in the prequels): for example, each clone trooper has distinct thoughts and personalities which make them much more as individuals as reflected by the Jedi Masters, rather than just mere tools. It's a touching quality that will eventually place an emotional weight on the movie series, especially Revenge of the Sith. Best of all, some of the elements from the much beloved classic trilogy are implemented in this series, probably to attract purists who have longed to recapture their magic moments, even if it may not entirely succeed in certain levels.\n\nLike every show on television, The Clone Wars is not without its flaws: part of the initial concepts of the TV series can be a little childish, considering that it is specially made for kids and the Battle Droids can get a little bit irritating, especially in the first episode where they are mostly portrayed as dim-witted cannon fodders: a major complaint amongst older viewers and stuff.

It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \"good cop, bad cop\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \"Rage,\" and \"Rooftop\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \"Law & Order\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \"Coerced.\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter).

Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson.

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10", "reviewTitle": "Maybe the best crime-series at the moment and very underrated I feel", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2005-01-25", "titleId": "/title/tt0203259/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "MichaelOates", "userId": "/user/ur3105386/"}, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6638328533759033, "id": "/title/tt0203259/userreviews/rw0655941", "interestingVotes": {"down": 37, "up": 106}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Quality is the foundation that \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" is based upon.

The storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking. In my classes, I've heard about the Down-Low phenomenon amongst black males in the U.S. This is the first show, aside from Oprah, that dealt with this issue. I was amazed and pleased that they'll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don't know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies.

Yes, it's more realistic and true to life, but that's not why I watch TV like this.

As the most liberal, feminist, pro-immigration, anti-racist, anti-fascist person around, having the views I already believe in forced down my throat every time I'm trying to chill out and watch TV is frustrating. It's also even more frustrating knowing how pointless it is - SVU is a crime show, it's not going to make anyone reconsider their politics, and it's dumb to isolate people from a show they've enjoyed for decades just because their politics differ to yours. The way it's all approached feels really patronising and tacky too - and the \"my way is the right way\" attitude is unhelpful in creating any positive political discussion.\n\nSeason 19 has been better than the past few seasons - there's been a few more engaging plot lines. It's still not even close to how it used to be though, where virtually every episode was an 8/10 with 9's being a common occurrence. Now it's more like every episode is a 5/10, and we're lucky if we get a 7.\n\nI don't watch the show regularly anymore; I just resort to it when there's literally nothing else I can think of to watch.

There are so many 'over the top' dark moments that are or could be funny, but at the expense or in the wake of extreme graphic brutality.\n\nI'm not saying this is bad, it just is. Film and television go through these kind of evolutionary jumps where something extreme is done and the 'shock and awe' of it creates a new level where it then becomes the new standard. Then Hollywood does what it always does, rinse and repeat, until we become desensitized to this new standard. Think back to the first 'Saw' movie.

On one hand, I want to review it and rave about it and try to convince others to see it. But then on the other hand, I realise that doing so could set expectations too high, which could then lead to some people getting disappointed (this happens a lot with horror movies that get hyped at film festivals and then rejected by disappointed wide audiences, like with The Witch, It Follows, and Hereditary).\n\nSo that leaves me in a tricky situation, and I'll compromise by praising the film as much as I can without overhyping, whilst also making vague comments that won't be specific enough to ruin what the film has to offer (because yes: it's a Scorsese film. He has an incredibly varied filmography when you break down just what he's made over the last half-century, and so you're never going to get exactly what you'd expect).\n\nOkay, acting: phenomenal. Besides Goodfellas, Pesci's best performance ever. This is the best De Niro's been since Cape Fear. This is the best Al Pacino has been in at least three decades. These men are old, and all accomplished and wealthy enough to retire happily at this point, but thankfully they all agreed to not only star in this movie, but commit themselves 100%. No one's phoning it in here. While the supporting cast are uniformly solid, these three steal the show and I hope all get Oscar nominations come awards season.\n\nScorsese, to no one's surprise, directs brilliantly throughout, making every scene purposeful and captivating. The movie is long, but deservedly so. The various pay-offs towards the film's conclusion would not hit nearly as hard if the film didn't spend so long building character, suspense, and emotion.\n\nAs crude as it might sound, this movie- at about the halfway point- made me forget how badly I needed to use the theatre's restroom. At a certain point, I accepted that I couldn't miss a second, and leaving the room for even a moment was totally out of the question.\n\nIf you can see this at a cinema, and can handle three and a half hours without a toilet or snack break (no intermission!), then by all means, watch it on a big screen, because it's beautiful and ultimately the best way to experience a film of this scope and spectacle. But it'll be on Netflix soon, and perhaps some would prefer to watch it in the comfort of their own home, where snack/toilet breaks are possible.\n\nWhatever you do, make sure you ultimately watch it. Films like this don't come around too often, and this is such a perfect swan-song for this talented group that I doubt we'll see these legends together again.\n\nIt's bittersweet, but if this is Scorsese's, De Niro's, Pacino's and Pesci's farewell to the crime genre, then it's an amazing note to go out on.", "reviewTitle": "It's brilliant, but best to go in with as few expectations as possible", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-11-08", "titleId": "/title/tt1302006/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "redcanofevil", "userId": "/user/ur83147698/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6828732138091574, "id": "/title/tt1302006/userreviews/rw5285667", "interestingVotes": {"down": 176, "up": 451}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I don't know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it's better than never seeing it.\n\nIt's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it's easily one of the best ones out there.\n\nThe plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that's all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that's a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn't mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn't. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn't shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.\n\nThe cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn't have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn't innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.\n\nThe main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn't it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn't get you excited for this film then I'm afraid nothing will.\n\nSpeaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!\n\nWhen was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that's exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.\n\nAnd boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don't worry he's still intense as usual. And that's weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you're looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you're in the right place.\n\nHarvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can't believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn't really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.\n\nThe film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn't boring in any way but felt it could've been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I've ever seen honestly.\n\nDespite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn't set out to do something different, it doesn't try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It's the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style.", "reviewTitle": "The Last Of Its Kind", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-11-28", "titleId": "/title/tt1302006/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "keelhaul-80856", "userId": "/user/ur79972010/"}, "authorRating": 5, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6538541706474856, "id": "/title/tt1302006/userreviews/rw5294395", "interestingVotes": {"down": 81, "up": 198}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I love all the films of this genre-- Casino, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Godfather, Mean Streets, Scarface, The Departed, Carlito's Way, Taxi Driver, etc. Scorsese makes some awesome epics, and I like a wide variety of other directors and their films in this vein. However, I find the hype and the hooplah around this one to fall a bit flat. I am sure I will receive some hate for this opinion, but this movie is nowhere near the level of Goodfellas or Scarface.\n\n1) The Run Time= I am fine with a 3.5 hour movie, but it needs to be great enough to fill that amount of time. I mean, at least 60-75% of it should be amazing. This movie is WAY TOO LONG for no reason. I can think of about 5 scenes that could be cut or condensed that did nothing to further the plot.\n\n2) The Aging and De-Aging of Actors= This was actually very distracting from the movie, and made me laugh in several scenes. Was this really NECESSARY? It seemed cheap and corny, and it really takes away from the movie instead of helping it. Wouldn't it be better to just get younger actors to play the really young scenes of DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, etc??? No one is buying the age of these guys, even with CGI technology and effects. It ruined the belief of the moment.\n\n3) Pesci looked 139 years old throughout the movie, even in scenes where he is supposed to be young.\n\n4) Harvey Keitel's talent and presence was greatly wasted, as I barely remember anything that he did or said.\n\n5) The Women= the ladies are mentioned at the start of the film by name, and then become completely irrelevant to anything that goes on for 3 hours. They were extremely underdeveloped. This was one thing that complimented Goodfellas well- Ray Liotta's wife was always in the mix, or screwing something up, or threatening to kill him, etc.\n\n6) Lack of Suspense or Action= This movie became very run-of-the-mill boring after an hour or so. Nothing surprised me, nothing was exciting, and the action is so neutered and far between that I forgot I was watching a gangster flick. I can still remember Pesci stabbing a guy in the throat with a pen in Casino, or Scarface's last stand, or the beatings given out in Goodfellas. This movie barely had ANY MEMORABLE SCENES that stand out. The only great ones were a couple of really quick and realistic shootings of guys on the street or in an eatery by DeNiro.\n\n7) Pacino as Hoffa= He doesn't even resemble Hoffa at all, and neither do other people portraying certain characters. Robert Kennedy comes to mind as well.\n\nThis is a decent movie, with great production values, classic actors, a legendary director, and nostalgic music with a great soundtrack. However, I just think a 8 or 9 rating is BS for this project. EVERYONE IS SIMPLY SAYING WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO SAY, just like every other overhyped movie or author or artist. It is a good movie, but far from a masterpiece, or Scorsese's crowning achievement, despite what everyone says.\n\nScarface, Goodfellas, Godfather, Departed= all light years beyond this movie, and with a shorter run time. This film needed to be tightened up and given some better scenes. It is interesting, but overbloated and overhyped due to the cast and director-- which can do no wrong in the minds of the average critic or average joe.", "reviewTitle": "I love Scorsese and all the great mobster flicks, but this one is OVERRATED...", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-12-02", "titleId": "/title/tt1302006/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "horrorgasm", "userId": "/user/ur8035952/"}, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6380909875203908, "id": "/title/tt1302006/userreviews/rw5294734", "interestingVotes": {"down": 64, "up": 151}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "You have to be absolutely out of your mind to legitimately think that this is Scorcese at his best and ignore all the flaws in this movie. Yes, I get it, he made a lot of great movies in his time, but this isn't one of them.\n\nA scene early on with Deniro beating someone up sums up the movie pretty well. The random no-name actor getting beat up is the only one exhibiting any emotion, as Deniro's character and his daughter sleepwalk their way through the scene like most of the cast does through most other scenes. It can be a bit hard to tell though since the camera zooms out so far that you can hardly see their faces, probably in an effort to avoid using the piss poor de-aging effects during an \"action\" scene, but it doesn't much matter because it's still close enough that we can see Deniro noticeably physically struggling to get through the scene. It looks awful and its depressing to see Deniro like this and to realize that Scorcese thought this scene was ok like this (why would they not have just used a stand-in here?), and this is pretty much how the movie feels in general.\n\nThis is a very noticeably weak effort from Scorcese. Most of the characters are wooden and just seem bored to be there. Pesci and Deniro are shockingly lifeless here. Pacino seems to be the only one giving any effort, but even his performance only comes off like a pale imitation of his old self.\n\nAgain, the de-aging effects are very weak and it's pretty jarring to see the flashback version of Deniro's character be referred to as if he's a young man (Pesci even calls him KID), but still looks like he's about 50.\n\nThere are a ton of side characters introduced, most of which disappear immediately after their introductions and serve no real purpose. Likewise there are many vestigial scenes that serve no purpose to advance either plot or character.\n\nThe plot is of course your typical gangster fare that we've seen from Scorcese so many times already. Guy gets into a life of crime, rises in the ranks, gets rich and lives it up, and then everything comes crashing down because he and everyone else he knows are absolutely terrible people, blah blah blah, we've seen it all before, but you know, you take something more recent of his like The Wolf of Wall Street and even though it uses that same old formula it still manages to be interesting because the characters have such personality and style and they keep your eyes glued to the conflict even though you already know exactly where it's going.\n\nHere? Not so much. The Irishman is an absolutely unremarkable mobster story with completely forgettable characters that don't seem at all interested in their roles and some production values and cinematography that the so-called king of cinema should be embarrassed to be associated with, and let me tell you, you people defending this weak excuse for a film aren't doing Scorcese or \"cinema\" any favors by blindly swallowing this crap and acting like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen. If you're so willing to suck down any product, no matter how bad, just because it has a big time famous name attached to it than you're really no better than the popcorn action movies and fans that you're so quick to condemn.\n\nAs someone who's seen every Scorcese film before this, this is a 5/10 AT BEST and I will never pretend otherwise just because he did a lot of great films in the past.", "reviewTitle": "Latest entry in the Emperor's New Clothes Club", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-12-02", "titleId": "/title/tt1302006/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "aGlassofCinema_com", "userId": "/user/ur107883470/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.6177084569192071, "id": "/title/tt1302006/userreviews/rw5147109", "interestingVotes": {"down": 261, "up": 490}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I was able to attend the NYC premiere this afternoon. Now that I've gotten over the shock of seeing so many celebrities, I'm able to happily to say that this movie, while being quite long, deserves to be remembered as one of Scorsese's great films.\n\nThe Irishman reminds me a bit of Tarantino's recent hit Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, both because it's a period piece and also because you need to know a little history to understand the direction of the narrative. The movie, while following Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) as the titular character, revolves around Teamsters union boss James Riddle Hoffa (played with intense and hilarious fervor by Al Pacino). Fortunately Frank goes to great lengths to narrate the story for the audience and provides a healthy dose of context for those of us not from the Kennedy era. The main thing you need to know going in is that Jimmy Hoffa had mob ties, and that he vanished in 1975 and was presumed murdered by mob bosses for being \"uncooperative\".\n\nThe movie unfolds over four acts, told over several decades by Frank Sheeran. In act one, Frank is introduced as a WWII veteran who is stuck driving food delivery trucks in and around Philadelphia. He has the bright idea to steal some of the steaks that he's delivering, and sell them to local mobster Felix \"Skinny Razor\" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). Eventually his brazen willingness to break the law catches the eye of Italian mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who happens to be a mobster on a national level. His calm demeanor is both comical yet terrifying. A soon to be classic line encompasses Bufalino perfectly: \"You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation.\" Under his mentorship, Frank becomes a ruthless action man for the italian mob and explains with rather entertaining dispassion how he does his job properly. In act two, Russell introduces Frank to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the outspoken and fearless president of the National Teamsters Union. Their relationship grows and Hoffa becomes Frank's second mentor. Together they use intimidation and bribery to gain influence until the election of John Kennedy, who subsequently appoints his brother Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General and immediately goes after Hoffa.\n\nThe first two and a half hours are the most fun, and in particular the end of act three is some of the most tense and dramatic storytelling that I have had the pleasure of seeing in recent memory. At a dinner celebration for Frank (who eventually becomes a Teamster boss himself), tensions between Hoffa, Bufalino and the other mobsters reaches a breaking point, and the decision is made to make Hoffa disappear. But in a gut wrenching twist, Frank is the one tasked to do the job. In a beautiful display of cinematography over a thirty-minute buildup, Scorsese forces the viewer to the edge of their seats with the dread of what's about to happen. Robert De Niro's performance in these moments is master class; the inner conflict is all the more apparent thanks all of the time we spent watching Frank being raised by Bufalino and Hoffa in equal measure. I plan to watch this part of the film again, probably with a notepad.\n\nGetting away from the plot a bit, the movie is actually surprisingly funny. In one particular scene, someone insults an older Bufalino at a dinner reception. He and Frank exchange glances, and the frame suddenly cuts to a hotel bed covered in guns. Frank then narrates with excess detail and hilarious dispassion the ideal weapon for a public assassination. Moments like these are littered throughout the film and keep it from getting too bogged down in it's violence. It's impressive how quickly jokes fly, given the disproportionate amount of people getting shot point blank in the head. But anyone who has seen Scorsese's Goodfellas or The Departed will feel right at home.\n\nThe heart of the movie is definitely Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. De Niro was de-aged with apparently exorbitantly priced CGI, as he is supposed to be younger than both Pacino and Pesci. While it's fairly obvious, I was never too distracted to not enjoy what was unfolding onscreen. Plus he's kind of made a career of holding one scowling facial expression, so that probably was a little easier to edit. Al Pacino is a riot as Hoffa, and is certainly one of the most arrogant, over-the-top characters that Pacino has played in awhile. Pesci as Bufalino is chilling, and it's fun to seem him as the boss in this gangster movie after being a junior-level mobster in Goodfellas so many years ago. The mentorship between De Niro's character and both Pacino and Pesci is amazingly entertaining.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from calling this movie perfect is it's length. Three hours and (almost) thirty minutes is a very long time, and while occurring infrequently the movie does drag a bit. This is most apparent in the fourth act where Frank introspects during his final years, and attempts to achieve reconciliation for all the murders he's committed. It doesn't really offer any closure or seem necessary to wrapping up the narrative.\n\nUltimately that doesn't even come close to making me not recommend seeing The Irishman. There's a reason Martin Scorsese will forever be known for his gangster movies. Combining comedy, violence, brotherhood and drama, he has created a formula that continues to work. The fact that he continues to make excellent movies at 76 years old blows my mind.

The story is weak (by Scorsese standard) and overly stretched. I can understand the appeal to revisit his trademark Italian gangster genre one more time, but this one feels unnecessary. The also trademark Scorsese humor is in-existent (except for the painting walls bit). De Niro looks disoriented, in the worst physical (hunched over almost the whole movie) and acting shape ever and out of place. Not very surprising, either. He spent the better part of the last 15 to 20 years doing mock impressions of himself which after the novelty faded ended him up in a series of quite dubious productions. That's a very long time to lower the bar and obviously takes its toll.\n\nThe De-aging technique is unconvincing when the actors move. Their faces look animated, fake. There is little and uninspired music. Keitel looks fantastic but is underused. Pacino kinda overacts on occasion. Pesci looks fantastic and is in top form acting-wise but he's also in a supporting role (he's the best part of the movie) so he doesn't have a big impact on the movie. Romano is in top form but his part is also small.\n\nThe movie is slow, linear, extremely long, predictable (how often have we seen the Hoffa story on screen? a superior version starring Nicholson comes to mind) and dull. There isn't much going on action-wise. A lot of innuendo and he said they said, but aside some quite dull hit-jobs where de Niro is supposed to be in his prime but moves like a 75 year old the story is quite static. The dialog is stale. Stunts are weak to say the least (Pacino's double excessively hiding his face when he hits the floor in a fight and obviously wearing a wig and body padding, and the store owner more than obviously throwing himself through the window of the store while De Niro clumsily mimics hitting him around come to mind, rendering those scenes borderline laughable). Colors, interiors, costumes are all in shades of beige. Camera work is rigid. Plus the Hoffa story is old news to begin with, there are so many insane things going on right now and would translate better to the screen in 2019. The edgy fast paced crazy energy of the more recent Wolf of Wall Street (not to mention his earlier masterpieces Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets or Goodfellas etc) seems that of a different director.\n\nAll in all the weakest film in Scorsese's portfolio and not above a 6 stars out of 10 by any standard (I'm inclined to be lenient mainly because he managed to bring Pesci out of retirement for this. But by Scorsese standard it's well below that). It's more of a self-indulgent piece of nostalgia best left unmentioned when it's all said and done.

He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?\n\nPacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.\n\nMrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nThis film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.\n\nTHE GOOD: Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, \"A Bronx Tale\", which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.\n\nTHE BAD: Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.\n\nTHE UGLY: The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!\n\nSadly, I rate it a dismal 2 out of 10.

They hang the entire picture on the believability of the de-aging, and it doesn't work for a second. It's egregious, bizarre, and will age horribly for the simple reason it's not registering as acting because computer programmers are doing the acting via mouseclicks. For Marty, a purest of cinema, to have this little respect for the purity of performance marks this as hypocrisy how he trashes blockbuster film. This is the theme park ride.

I love it more than 3000.\n\nHappiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.\n\nIt is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever.

Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.\n\n**SPOILER ALERT**\n\nEven some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like \"I'm the strongest\" and \"You didn't win because before you didn't have me\" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.\n\nAlso I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.\n\nI'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.\n\nWhen the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!\n\nThis movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning.

Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the \"I can do this all day\" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.\n\nI loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.\n\nThe deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.\n\nKilling off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.\n\nThe real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.\n\nThe most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.\n\nThere are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.\n\nI also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.\n\nSo okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.", "reviewTitle": "Amazing, but the more I dwell on it the worse it becomes", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-04-26", "titleId": "/title/tt4154796/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "ahmetkozan", "userId": "/user/ur48829349/"}, "authorRating": 10, "helpfulnessScore": 0.553282546187161, "id": "/title/tt4154796/userreviews/rw4802892", "interestingVotes": {"down": 1537, "up": 2034}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.\n\nOn the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.\n\nAvengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.\n\nOf course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.\n\nLastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future.

Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie.

I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU \"isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?\" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line\" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to.", "reviewTitle": "Terrible Ending to a 22 movie Arc", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2019-06-03", "titleId": "/title/tt4154796/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "saimonsisir", "userId": "/user/ur89794376/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5362233498015684, "id": "/title/tt4154796/userreviews/rw4920246", "interestingVotes": {"down": 184, "up": 257}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.", "reviewTitle": "not good", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-06-08", "titleId": "/title/tt4154796/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "woah-24491", "userId": "/user/ur82224653/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5362061068414452, "id": "/title/tt4154796/userreviews/rw5042181", "interestingVotes": {"down": 199, "up": 276}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This movie was a joke,average superhero movie where the heroes win and everyone's happy, hounestly zero dialogue this whole thing is just liked because marvel is ending, this movie made people \"cry\"?really?the only thing that made me cry was my money I spent on seeing this garbage, thor was ruined along with hulk, thanks was dumber down,and capitain marvels horrible scenes were pain full to sit through,hounestly I'm glad people are coming to their senses and rating this movie lower now that they rewatch it, it's full of plot holes and the time travel is embarrassing lazy writing that's a disgrace to real time travel movies,besides the hype this movie had nothing it was 100% hypebased in fact I dont think anyone acctually paid attention to the movie, the ending was extremely predictable and the final battle was bland with the only background colors being brown and destroyed ships so disapointing after the amazing movie that showed that superhero movies can be more then saving the day and the bad guys losing", "reviewTitle": "Most overrated movie ever", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2019-08-05", "titleId": "/title/tt4154796/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "rmills411", "userId": "/user/ur2223081/"}, "authorRating": 1, "helpfulnessScore": 0.5355884740691871, "id": "/title/tt4154796/userreviews/rw5050947", "interestingVotes": {"down": 132, "up": 190}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "It was a fairly entertaining film for the first couple of hours (probably worth a 6 or 7), with a few exceptions, - not least the abomination of making Thor a fat drunken slob.

This documentary takes on a great topic, then beats the hell out of it. The threat of a pandemic is real and seeing what is being done to help prevent it is interesting and educating.

You also get to see a lot of things you may not be expecting such as personal lives, descriptions of religious beliefs, extracurricular activities, etc. This may not be such a bad thing, but it is done to an extent that leaves the movie jumping between important scientific endeavor within the context of public health, and somewhat disjointed and rather uninteresting topics outside the realm of what the movie claims to be. A \"6\" is an honest ranking that doesn't pump it up, and doesn't push it too undeservedly low. Next, comments on the widely varying reviews.

The healthcare providers were just very generic (a doc in a rural community, one in a sort of refugee detainment center, etc.). Some of this was loosely tied to how hard it is to get flu vaccines in and funding in rural communities, but very loosely. If anything it started to feel more politically tied than flu/outbreak/pandemic related.\n\nThe real issue is after watching that entire season, I don't feel like I know that much more about the flu itself. What's being done to create vaccines? Other than one makeshift crew in San Fransisco we know nothing. How exactly does it mutate? Wasn't discussed that I heard. What makes one emergent strain more likely to spread than another? What do the \"H\" and the \"N\" along with the corresponding number mean when a virus is labeled? I really don't know.\n\nMaybe if a reality show following people who work around the flu or work in prevention is what you're expecting you won't be disappointed.

This premise is most clearly seen at the end - and when you look at the plot in retrospect, it's entirely clear that a time loop may never have existed! As the time loop changes, Mary's history is too. As Rose changes the past, it becomes Mary's real present. By the end of the movie she is in the apartment of the woman who abducted her and hurt her as a child! This leads up to the idea that perhaps there was never a time loop, that perhaps Mary's having a psychotic breakdown and imagining what looks like a time warp, and that maybe Mary returned to Rose's apartment (where she was abducted and held as a child) to kill and hide her abusive husband (who has stalked her all the way back to Puerto Rico) in the wall where Rose's victims lay undiscovered! A psychotic break that leads to an unconscious plan to lure and murder her husband! The change in the perception of reality = The change in quantum reality. The First is the psychological premise in the movie, and the second is its scientific premise. The reason why none of the many whys you keep bringing up are never answered is because as the past changed, so would everything that the whys would have explained - so explaining all the whys would have been pointless, seeing how it all would have changed anyway!

Nothing too out of the ordinary, but it presents a pretty creepy premise which finds her trapped in a spiralling cycle of torture and paranoia from a very nasty supernatural adversary.\n\nThe Caller is a 'slow burner.'

The Caller just might be the most underrated Horror film of 2011, or even ever! So please let me start by recommending that you don't let yourself miss out on it, as you could easily find one million films that would be less fun to watch.\n\nThe plot is realistic and relatable, slightly feminist but not in an annoying criticizing way (I hate seeing socio-political agendas and messages in fiction films, regardless of what they are). Mary has recently left her abusive husband and is now living alone in a new apartment. Great acting by Rachelle Lefevre, who is very different than your usual \"blond with blue eyes\" in Horror films.\n\nAs for the story - one of the best most original ideas I've ever seen in a Horror film. Perhaps the idea has been done before, but it's been a first time for me. Many Horror films attempt to make the audience scared and uncomfortable by relating to the terror and despair that are felt by the characters. The Caller does that in a remarkable way that is both original (even if not ground breaking) and immensely effective! That's the way to connect cross-time from Sc-Fi to victim control in Horror!\n\nThe cinematography is slightly disappointing, and some of the shots simply appeared a little amateur, as if done by someone not very comfortable with a camera. However, the profound audio effects really make up for it, I really liked them! And to top it all - not one of the annoying overused cheats appear! No visible silicone breasts, no death on account of car not starting, not even an inability to communicate due to a cellphone having no signal! Not to mention there's no use of the corny \"sudden loud music to make you jump\". There are a few scenes with quiet, close-up and then sudden noise, but delicately and gently done.\n\nAll in all - I don't like rating films too high, nor too low. I always look for shortcomings on account of being a pretty easy grader. The Caller, in my opinion, deserves a heck of a lot more recognition and compliments than it's been given. I loved every second of it, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a truly well made Horror film.", "reviewTitle": "Excellent and well made!!!

The problem is that they never really got any further than that, and it plays out rather stereotypically, with heavy-handed direction, bland characters, trite plotting, and weak dialogue. What really saved the movie, however, was Lorna Raver, who played the crazy gypsy woman in Drag Me To Hell. Man, that woman is creepy! Just hearing her voice on the phone was enough to creep me out. Without her, this movie would only be a 4/10. I'm tempted to give this movie a 6/10, just because of her, but she was the only good thing in it, really.\n\nThere are a few times when you're left scratching your head, wondering why the characters are so dumb, but these kinds of thrillers absolutely depend on stupid characters doing things that defy all common sense. If that kind of thing annoys you, I'd avoid this movie. Otherwise, if you're not expecting much and lower your expectations, you might find this an enjoyable waste of time. It's nothing special, but it's not offensively bad, either. If you liked this movie, I'd suggest checking out 100 Feet, a supernatural thriller featuring an abused wife trying to convince people that she's being haunted by her dead, abusive husband.

They really don't make 'em like this anymore! While there are many elements that on the surface the viewer have seen in many other films, it's what's underneath that counts. This film takes several previously used elements and molds them into a profound, scary horror film that I think will steadily gain ground over the years.\n\nAs opposed to many modern horror films, The Caller is very old-fashioned and gritty-looking in presentation and tone. It takes it's sweet time to draw the viewer into it's world. Set in present-day Puerto Rico, beautiful, young, and recently divorced Mary (superbly performed by Rachelle Lefevre) has just moved into her own apartment in an old building. She starts getting mysterious phone calls on her landline from an odd, depressed, and psychotic woman named Rose. At first, Mary shrugs her off, then as the plot thickens, she becomes intrigued by this lady.\n\nMary and Rose share similarities, as both are involved with abusive, neglectful spouses and both women are lonely and depressed. During one of their conversations, Mary playfully suggests to Rose to \"get rid of\" her spouse, which Rose later confirms she does. Then things get really tense! Mary tries to cut off ties with Rose, but there is an incredible complication (which I won't spoil) as Mary finds that she is connected to Rose more than she initially knew.\n\nAlong the way, Mary befriends and gets help in her Rose predicament from a couple of male figures, her gardener-landlord George (underplayed by the reliable veteran actor Luiz Guzman) and a teacher named John (well played by Stephen Moyer) at her night school, who she eventually strikes up a romance with.\n\nThe thing that I love about this horror film is that it can be interpreted in several ways and has several layers. The trajectory of the Mary-Rose dynamic throughout the film is enthralling and rides a roller-coaster of emotions. Interesting that we never really SEE much of Rose, yet she's such a complicated, interesting character just be her voice and machinations. And Lefevre as Mary hits ALL the right notes, convincingly relaying Mary's sadness, loneliness, depression, fear, and, in the end, resilience. Really great work by this up and coming actress!

The problem is one of expectations, and also one of substance. The user-reviews here made it sound like one of the best horror movies of the year, so as it started to fall apart, I got more and more frustrated with it. I now see that these are planted reviews. It's not even very subtle shilling, I'm sorry I fell for it.\n\nIf you have not yet watched it, feel free to do so, but try to lower your expectations. This is a small, tense thriller with good cinematography, a pretty lead actress, and some jumpy bits. It's not the best or most terrifying horror movie, and the ending mostly makes you want to come up with better endings. But hey, it's probably better than Saw 12.\n\n{Spoilers begin now.} \n\nIf you have already seen this movie, and you came back to IMDb to reread some of the glowing reviews to see what they liked about it, like I did, let's chat.\n\nThe way I see it, this movie starts out a 7 or so, but slowly drags its way down to a 3 by the end, almost willfully. The beginning is interesting, there are hints of the crumbling relationship, hints of a new beginning, and a vague sense that something is wrong. The editing keeps throwing things at you with loud crashes and bangs so that you don't forget to be tense, I guess. This style of editing is really annoying more than anything, as it keeps reminding me I'm watching a movie rather than getting me invested in the damn thing. But it's a style and I'm used to it.\n\nAs the picture goes on, I got more and more annoyed by something I couldn't quite place. I think it's just the thinness of the script. The relationship she's just left with \"Steven\" was what? How long were they married? Where were they before? Were they ever happy? Was he a psycho the entire marriage? Because that's really all he ever seems to be. Why would a hot girl like her ever be with an aggro jerk who looks like an ugly William Mapother? \n\nAnd then French class. While I admit Hunky guy's little bit of dialogue in the classroom scene is charming.... why was she taking a French class? Did she always want to learn French? Was this just to leave the apartment? Did she just want to meet Hunky guy? From here on in, the character development gets downright weird. Her relationship with him seems to be based more on sitting and standing near each other in places than any commonalities or shared interests.\n\nBy halfway through the movie I realized I was never going to learn anything about anyone. This script just moseys from event to event: Meet Hunky guy, check. Go on date, check. Creepy phone call, check. Brick wall, check. Creepy phone call, but it's really just mom, check. Actual creepy phone call, check. Have awkward floor sex five feet from his bedroom, check. Creepy phone call but it's really a dream, check. Kill Luis Guzman for no reason, check. Oh, yeah, creepy ex, kinda forgot him for a while, check.\n\nThe thing that's so dull about the second half isn't that the events are terribly predictable. Sure, you know that Rose will do something to her back then as soon as she mentions the photo session, but the burning was a cool enough effect. And it's not the lack of almost any actual on-screen horror. (Though who pitches a horror movie with \"You'll never see any of the killings!\" as a selling point?) The trouble is that we never get to know anyone so we don't know why they're doing anything or care that they're doing it.\n\nWho is Rose? Why is she doing all this? Why is she so ready to believe that the other end of the phone call is in the future? Is she crazy? What made her so crazy? For that matter, why does she get all psycho with Mary? Why did she go from \"You're my best friend\" to \"I'mma eff your life up!\"? \n\nWho is Mary? What does she even do for a living? Is there something in her past that makes her inexorably gullible, or is that a natural trait? Is there no 911 service in Puerto Rico, or does she have some bad history with the police? Why does she even answer the land-line when she has a damn cell-phone? \n\nWho is Luis Guzman's character? Does he own the building? Is he the super? Why can't he fix the damn AC? Who is Hunky guy? Why is he single at his age? Who is her ex? Does he have a job? Or does his business card read \"Stalker\"? Why with only five people in the movie do I not even know who one of them is? \n\nAnyway, I think that's really my big problem with the movie. The premise, setup, and plot are so simple.

It is a much more imagination - and yes, creepy - supernatural flick than a lot of the junk we've gotten lately (\"The Last Exorcism,\" \"Needle,\" to name a few). It's not immensely scary, but it's playfully off-putting and very fun to look at.\n\nThe movie was promisingly directed by a man named Matthew Parkhill, who appears to have a cinematic fetish for trick focus. There is hardly a shot in \"The Caller\" (or maybe none at all!) where both the foreground and background are focused and defined. There are even fewer where it tricks back and forth. Parkhill likes to have either the background in focus, or the foreground. But not both. It's an unusual rhythm, but not an ostentatiously lofty one either. And it is effectively used, particularly in his dolly shots, where we see little objects like phone cords or coffee mugs sharp and clear while the petrified protagonist quarrels with her unseen stalker.\n\nThe said creep is a mysterious old lady who is only present via untraceable phone calls. Rachelle Lefevre plays her on-the-bum character with an easygoing dryness as a recent divorc\u00e9e moving into a ramshackle apartment. She is hounded by the titular \"caller\" who insists that her lover still lives there. The plot needs a whole lot more complicated from here, but not ridiculously so. It's not being complicated for the sake of being complicated. Rather, it's being complicated just to be interesting. Movies with that sort of attitude are rare these days; most of them just want to brow-beat the audience with plot twists until you need a notepad to follow everything.\n\n\"The Caller\" is not a hair-raiser; it's not intensely scary. Granted, it does have a few good shock moments and some even better suspense. But those who favor biting their nails and running from the screen are liable to be disappointed. But the primary reason why it comes across so effectively, and director Parkhill and screenwriter Sergio Casci are owed big credit for this, is that it aims just for being creepy. Lefevre's personable performance allows the audience to get into the shoes of the victim being tormented, as opposed to the killer, and when things start turning for the bizarre, we are allowed to sympathize with her.\n\nThe picture is not flawless. The ending is lopsided and not as ambiguous and it would like to be and there is an utterly pointless sex scene that interrupts an otherwise fascinating romantic subplot. But as a totality, \"The Caller\" is a joyfully enjoyable little horror flick.", "reviewTitle": "It's not immensely scary, but it's playfully off-putting and very fun to look at", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2012-03-11", "titleId": "/title/tt1525890/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "ArisMichael", "userId": "/user/ur54758869/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.30574289688783723, "id": "/title/tt1525890/userreviews/rw3072976", "interestingVotes": {"down": 3, "up": 5}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "This movie has a genuinely great plot and to my surprise (and disappointment), I see many theories floating around the ending, when it is much clearer and simpler to comprehend.\n\nMy personal view on the flaws of the movie are the following: \u0095 The characters lacked depth, especially for the main actress, Mary, who was a typical young woman, moving in a new apartment. There are some bits throughout the movie that I was convinced of her escalating fear, but I did not find her acting astounding. \u0095 The cast was pretty limited and solely served the plot's ending. Other than that, each presence was marginally useful. \u0095 The setting was also limited; everything was taking place in a house and its yard. I would like to see Mary's life and routine and how truly was she disoriented by the calls. The usual empathy that arises to the viewer did not occur to me, as I was unable to witness the struggle of hers to survive a scary voice. This is exactly why I think we should have more scenes of her life introduced to us, which would, by extension, elaborately enhance the character's traits and personality. \u0095 I would expect more scenes with Rose's presence, as if she haunts Mary's thoughts; this would have an eerie feeling that was admittedly missing from the movie. Shadow passing while she was sleeping, waking up by the tormentor's voice (Rose's), etc. These may be typical, but I would enjoy the film a lot more.\n\nI have rated the movie with 9/10 for its fantastic plot.\n\nI shall now hint out the ending and its interpretation:\n\nThe people Mary met were not ghosts, whose bodies were recovered after years. Remember how Rose was calling from the past: this means that Mary's friend (John) was a child back then (Mary as well). Once Rose realized that she was threatened by John, who, without any hesitation, talked her out on the phone, she took him (in her time) as a child and killed him. Through this action, she changed the future. If she killed someone in the past, that person no longer exists in the future. Thus, he was not a ghost, it was that Rose changed the past and consequently, the future. This is why John's body was a child's, because if he was killed in Rose's era, he wouldn't grow up to be the person Mary met.\n\nThere is also a question about how the past met the present (how did Rose break into Mary's house). Given Rose's resentment to Mary's behavior and persistent lies, she reached out to find Mary when she was a child (because Mary was a child in the year Rose was calling). Rose then made her suffer, which would in turn cause a trauma to Mary. She also spilled boiled water on her and this is why the marks started appearing on the adult Mary - because if Rose did this in the past, the present Mary would already have these marks on her. Since she bore this traumatic experience, she started reliving her past, when she was hearing her younger self on the phone. It was because Rose took her as a child and inflicted all of this psychological trouble on her that Mary would suddenly see Rose busting through the door, the way she did when Mary was a child. Obviously, as a child, she was indeed talking to her adult self, who guided her into locking herself in the bathroom.\n\nFinally, it has also been asked why she killed her ex. The explanation is pretty much answered above. Since Rose took her as a child and, as a consequence, changed Mary's today's mental state, the traumatic experience was channeled as aggressive behavior and psychological instability. This enabled her to engage in a criminal activity without a second thought (something that would never occur, if she had never answered the phone or had not provoked Rose).\n\nEven though the matter of how the subsequent calls from the past were achieved (as in how was the past bridged to the present) remained somehow transparent, a theory was still addressed by John, when he drew the curved line of time, with a break point on top, to give Mary an explanation.\n\nAll in all, this was one of my favorite movies. It is rumored to have an open ending, but frankly, it is not as ambiguous as it is thought to be.", "reviewTitle": "Very intricate plot and highly incisive", "spoiler": true, "submissionDate": "2014-08-21", "titleId": "/title/tt1525890/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "Jlovesderek", "userId": "/user/ur9109592/"}, "authorRating": 9, "helpfulnessScore": 0.30117018733785916, "id": "/title/tt1525890/userreviews/rw2486743", "interestingVotes": {"down": 7, "up": 8}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "I just watched The Caller and I'm impressed with the movie. The story idea is not exactly unique, but they did a great job with the movie.

There is not one boring moment in this film.

And as most of you who have netflix know. Life is busy and it just sat there and wasted my monthly membership lol. And to be honest I didn't think it was going to be very good. Well I'm happy to say I was wrong. The film is a completely original horror esque thriller thats solidly executed. It stars Rachael Lefvre of the Twilight films as a young woman who moves into an apartment after an abusive marriage. She's constantly stalked by her creepy ex and is always on the edge. She than begins to receive strange phone calls looking for someone who doesn't live here. As the crazed calls proceed she questionably finds out that the woman who is speaking to her lived in her apartment in the 70's and is actually calling from the 70's. it's all very twilight zone esque. but here's the big kicker. She's brutally psychotic and as the young woman tries to ignore the phone calls things and people begin to change in Lefvre's life because the crazed woman is murdering them in the past. Now I don't want to give away any twists but the film has got some really shockingly creepy moments. And it somehow makes the simplicity of the house phone menacing again. The cool thing about this movie is that it keeps you going and going and even ends with an unexpected nice bang. Also Lefvre's lead performance is really quite surprising she's strong, vulnerable and comes across as a very capable actress. But the film does have a few weaknesses such as the film quality. It feels very cloudy and cheap like something off the lifetime network, something thats sure to distract you a bit from the films quality in the beginning. And there is a cheesy little romance with a surprisingly sexy Stephen Moyer of True Blood fame. Accompanied by a forced little sex scene. Nonetheless, It's a neat little movie thats worth seeking out and watching. It offers more quality thrills and solid storytelling than most of the films plaguing the multiplexes right now.", "reviewTitle": "The Caller", "spoiler": false, "submissionDate": "2012-01-08", "titleId": "/title/tt1525890/"}, {"author": {"displayName": "loomis78-815-989034", "userId": "/user/ur23697973/"}, "authorRating": 8, "helpfulnessScore": 0.2999938676281777, "id": "/title/tt1525890/userreviews/rw2966816", "interestingVotes": {"down": 2, "up": 4}, "languageCode": "eng", "reviewText": "Mary (Lefevre) moves into a run down apartment trying to escape her abusive ex-husband Steven (Quinn) who continues to stalk her despite a restraining order.

Mary and the audience are constantly kept off guard, and at the edge of their seat due to both Crazy Rose and just as crazy ex-husband who is stalking her. At times you wonder who is going to do more damage in Mary's life. Director Parkhill uses the creepy elements of the story very well to build tension and suspense.
