# Text Mining and Text Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project explores how computational techniques can be applied to analyze text and generate relevant information from it. The project is divided into two sections based on the data sources: Wikipedia and IMDB Reviews. The main objective of the Wikipedia analysis is to explore the idea of text similarity between two Wiki articles (based on the userâ€™s choice) and uncover the basic structure of the text, such as common words and word frequencies. On the other hand, the IMDB analysis will examine the relationship between the IMDB ratings and the score from sentiment analysis of user reviews.
