## Text Analysis of Jung and Freud's Psychology Paper

# Summary
This project aims to analyze texts from Carl Jung's and Freud's psychology papers to find similarities in two different arguments regarding the unconscious mind. 
The team used the Gutenberg Project to extract two books: Freud's "Dream Psychology" and Jung's "Collected Papers on Psychology."
The team later compares the similarity between these two texts with Wikipedia page "Psychology."
