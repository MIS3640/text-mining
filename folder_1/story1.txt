[It had been years since I’d actually looked at my old paintings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/m3i1z6/they_call_me_spacegirl_i_dont_paint_anymore/) I’m not sure what I’d been expecting. Maybe I’d anticipated that years of neglect had twisted them somehow, poisoned them into something else. Something different than what they’d been when I’d first created them.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure if I was relieved or disappointed to find that they looked more or less unchanged. Aside from some fresh injuries on the body of the Unicorn Prince, my old artwork looked just about the same as it had the day I’d put everything in that trunk. Some of the paper of my pencil sketches was creased and showed signs of age, but it was nothing that serious. Most of them looked the same as they had the day I’d locked them away.

&#x200B;

I set the wounded picture of the Unicorn Prince aside as I sifted through everything else. Old canvases were stacked on top of each other and I carefully took them out to set them upright. Among them, I recognized what used to be a portrait I’d done of Jane in High School. The sight of it sent a chill through me. Now, it depicted the screaming face of someone else, although it had been like that when I’d locked it away. I turned that particular canvas to face the wall so I wouldn’t have to look at it.Faded notebooks and folded sketches had settled near the bottom, and I tried to pile those up neatly.

&#x200B;

Sifting through everything brought back memories… Most of them were good, but not all of them. Fantasy landscapes I’d lovingly sketched and painted sat before me, dotted with beautiful creatures. Mermaids in quiet lagoons, pale deer in a peaceful forest, and white birds scattered amongst a vibrant red tree. The terrain seemed just as alive as its denizens did… As its denizens were.

&#x200B;

They were quiet for the moment, but I knew there was still life in them. It’s hard to say how, but I could sense it. The same way you can usually sense when somebody is in the room with you, even when you can’t see them. I felt a stab of guilt, for even considering destroying all of this. Looking at them now, they seemed harmless. Innocent, even.

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I noticed that the Unicorn Prince had moved within his painting. He was staring at me now, almost expectantly. Just what he wanted though, was a mystery. I heard the door of the apartment open and looked up, slightly startled.

&#x200B;

“Meg?” I heard a voice call. It was Jane. “Meg, are you there?”

I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised that she’d come home. Given how abruptly I’d left the Amber Mill, I should have known she’d come after me.

&#x200B;

“I’m in here,” I replied before standing up. Jane appeared in my doorway a minute later. I could see the clear concern on her face and the way her brow furrowed as she saw my old artwork laid out. Her eyes darted around the room for a moment before fixating on me.

&#x200B;

“Are you alright? What happened back there? You looked terrified, and then I saw the mural…”

My heart skipped a beat.

Of course, she’d noticed the Unicorn Prince at the Amber Mill. She was probably the only other person aside from me who would have.

“I’m fine,” I said quietly, although that was a lie and she knew it. She didn’t call me out on it. She just stared at me, waiting for the truth.

“I thought they were locked away.” I finally said, “I thought they couldn’t get out. Then I saw him and…”

Both of our gazes drifted over to the Unicorn Prince.

&#x200B;

“Do you know if anybody got hurt?” Jane asked quietly.

“I don’t think so. I don’t think they’re after anyone else this time. I think they’re just… Angry…”

“At what?”

“At me. I’m the one that made them, now I’ve gone and put them away… If it were me, I’d be angry.”

Jane was silent for a moment, thinking over her response. She kept her eyes trained on the painting of the Prince.

&#x200B;

“Do you think they’re capable of being angry at you?” She finally asked.

“I *know* they are. When I was coming home, I saw something in the street. Another Unicorn, just like the Prince. It was… It…”

My voice cracked. Saying the words suddenly felt difficult and admitting to Jane that I would have let the other Unicorn kill me was impossible. Even if I couldn’t get the words out, she still understood.

&#x200B;

“Jesus! You were attacked?”

I nodded. I could feel the tears starting to come again and did everything I could to hold them back. It was a sorry effort at best.

“By the Prince? Are you hurt?! What happened?!”

“I’m fine…” I said, trying to wipe my eyes. “It wasn’t the Prince. It was something else. A grey Unicorn. The Prince was the one who came to stop it…”

I don’t think that news really put Jane at ease. She still kept a wary eye on the painting and I could feel her arm around me as she shepherded me out of my bedroom.

&#x200B;

“You’re sure it was one of yours?” She asked.

“How many other living Unicorns have you seen, Jane?”

“Okay, okay. Fair point I guess… Do you need anything? Tea? Water? Did the other Unicorn hurt you?”

“I’m alright… I guess tea would be nice…”

&#x200B;

Jane escorted me to the couch and sat me down, before going to the kitchen to put on some tea.

“So if you’re right and they’re angry at you, what exactly are we going to do about this?” She asked.

“I don’t know… Maybe it would be best if you got a hotel or something for a few days. That way you’d be safe…”

“What, and leave you here to deal with them by yourself?” Jane asked.

“This is my own fault. If you got hurt because of this…”

“Hey, don’t go all broody on me here Spacegirl. I’m not going to just ditch you at the first sign of trouble!”

&#x200B;

Jane stepped out of the kitchen and leaned against the doorframe. I could hear the kettle running in the background.

“If I can help you with this, I’m doing it. Whatever you need from me. I’m here, and I’m staying here.”

I couldn’t argue with the conviction in her voice. I didn’t really want to either. I caught myself wiping at my eyes again.

“So. What are we going to do about this?” She asked again.

“I don’t know…” I finally said, “I haven’t exactly been able to reign them in before. I guess the Prince is still on my side, for now. I don’t know about the rest of them.”

“Okay. Well, if the Prince is still with you, that’s good? Right? You told me he was always the most protective of you.”

“I guess. But if they’re coming after me, I don’t know how much he can do.”

“Well, if he’s still on your side, I’d imagine there are others too, right?”

&#x200B;

“Maybe…” She probably had a point, but I didn’t want to hedge my bets on that, “I don’t know. I barely understood them back then and I haven’t exactly been trying to figure things out.”

“Well, no time like the present, right?”

All things considered, she sounded awfully chipper even if she was just doing it for my sake. She put on a gentle smile that made my heart beat just a little bit faster...

I thought things over for a few moments. I suppose she did have a point. I’d been trying to bury this for so long, maybe it was time I started trying to understand it.

&#x200B;

We spent the night going through my old paintings. I told Jane just about everything I could remember about my ability. I don’t think she fully understood most of it but, she tried. From the corner of my eye, I could see some of them moving. Watching me from their canvases. Whispering to each other.

&#x200B;

Part of me expected them to start getting closer. Closing in on me but they didn’t… Maybe it was just because Jane was there. I can’t say for sure. But having her there with me that night, telling her the things I’d never told anyone else… It made me feel safe when I needed that more than anything.

&#x200B;

As night fell, Jane eventually retired to bed. I would have done the same if I could have slept. Even after putting most of my old artwork back in its case, sleep just wouldn’t come to me. My brain kept running a thousand miles per second. Every little bump from a neighboring apartment jostled me wide awake again anytime I so much as started to feel drowsy.

&#x200B;

I needed another nightcap.

&#x200B;

I’d left the painting of the Prince up by my bed. Part of me had considered fixing it, but I didn’t have any paint. I could feel his eyes on me as I got up to my desk, to find my rum. The bottle was light with only a small pool of rum left at the bottom. Not enough to do the trick. I sank back down onto my bed, knowing I wasn’t going to get any sleep and replaying the talk I’d had with Jane before she’d gone to bed.

&#x200B;

Despite having told her everything I knew about my ability, we hadn’t exactly come to any conclusions. For all intents and purposes, we were stuck at square one. My attention shifted back to the painting of the Prince. He was still watching me.

“I don’t suppose you’d have any ideas, would you?” I asked.

He turned away from me and kicked idly at the ground. I took that as a no.

&#x200B;

The rain drummed against my window, lighter than before although it only added to the list of things keeping me awake. When you deal with insomnia, there always comes a point where you realize that you’re not going to sleep no matter how hard you try, so you decide to go and do something else. I was at that point.

&#x200B;

I glanced at the clock. One in the morning. There were probably a few student bars still open, and I still wanted that nightcap.

&#x200B;

I know that going outside was probably a mistake. But I thought a walk and a drink might do me some good. I had a bottle of pepper spray with me for self-defense, not that it would have done much good against a Unicorn, but I had a feeling I wouldn’t be completely alone on my walk. Maybe that was too cocky… But I hadn’t been alone last time.

&#x200B;

It didn’t take me long to find a bar that was still open and somewhat lively. It wasn’t one of my usual haunts, but that hardly mattered. The inside was warm and homey. It was charming enough, I suppose and the bar itself wasn’t crowded. I found a seat there and ordered myself a Manhattan.

&#x200B;

My mind wandered back to what Jane had said before. If the Prince was still there to protect me, there probably were other things I had created that weren’t hostile towards me. Maybe I was lucky and it was just the one grey Unicorn. If that was the case, maybe I could resolve this before it got worse. Maybe… How though?

&#x200B;

I had a slight headache that I blamed on exhaustion and massaged my temples. That didn’t seem to help. The pressure behind my eyes just seemed worse. The things I’d created had always just done what they wanted to, I’d never had control of them. So what could I do now? What choices did I have?

&#x200B;

“Excuse me? Is this seat taken?” A voice asked, drawing me out of my thoughts. I turned and looked to see a man, just a little older than I was standing at the seat beside me. He had dark hair, blue eyes and wore a grey sweater. I can’t quite remember what his face looked like.

“No,” I said idly, although I’d have preferred he not bother me. Maybe it was just my anxiety, but something about him seemed off.

“I hope I’m not intruding, but you looked upset.” He said.

“I’m fine.”

“You sure? You don’t look fine.”

&#x200B;

I took a sip of my drink to avoid answering and spied an empty seat further down the bar that I could take.

“I’m Keith. Nice to meet you.” He said. I hesitated for a moment before giving him my name. It would have been rude to just walk away, wouldn’t it?

“Megan.”

He offered me a hand to shake. I tentatively took it. He held on just a little too long.

“Megan, that’s a cute name. Do you go to Upper Lake too?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah… I do” I took another sip of my drink. It dawned on me that he was probably trying to flirt with me, and I wasn’t entirely sure what to think of that. Nobody had ever really flirted with me before, so I couldn’t tell if he was doing it well and I just didn’t want to deal with it, or if he was really bad at it.

“Nice. What’s your major?”

“History.”“Cool, I’m in business admin myself. It’s not bad. I like it.”

“Good for you.”

&#x200B;

I polished off my drink and looked for an opportunity to leave.

“Sorry… I’m bothering you, aren’t I?” He asked sheepishly. Now I just felt bad for thinking of ditching him.

“No, you’re not. I’m just… I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.”

“Like what?” He asked.

I sized him up for a moment, before deciding that maybe it might help to have someone to bounce some of my thoughts off of. The bar was still fairly public and I had pepper spray. So what was the worst that could happen?

&#x200B;

“I’m… Having some trouble with an old friend…” I said. I chose my words carefully. Even if I was a little tipsy, it was probably better not to give him all the details. “We used to be really close when I was younger, but… I guess we grew apart. I didn’t like the way they acted so I sorta shut them out.”

Keith just nodded along as I spoke.

“Now, I know they’re mad at me and I… I sort of want to fix things. I know it’s my own fault. I know that. But I still want to try…”

“Have you just tried, I dunno, talking to them?” Keith asked, “Seems like the obvious place to start to me.”

“I’m not sure that’s really going to work with them.”

“How do you know? You haven’t tried it yet.”

&#x200B;

I looked down at my empty glass. Maybe it was the alcohol but what he was saying almost made sense. I noticed him staring at me from the corner of my eye. Had his eyes always been green?

“Maybe…” I said quietly. I finished my drink as I thought over what he’d said. Had I ever tried to communicate with my artwork? Aside from the occasional gesture from the Unicorn Prince, I didn’t think I ever had…

It made more and more sense, the more I thought about it.

&#x200B;

“Give it a go. Maybe it’ll work out for you. And if not… Well. Not sure what to tell you.” He shrugged.

I’d made up my mind already, though. I reached for my wallet to leave some cash on the table. I had someplace else I wanted to be in that moment.

“Thanks.” I said, offering Keith a slight smile, “I think I’ll try that.”

“Let me know how it goes,” He said. “You stay safe now, Spacegirl...”

I was already at the door of the bar when he said that, and only barely heard him. Maybe if my mind wasn’t elsewhere, I’d have thought to ask him how he knew that name…

&#x200B;

I couldn’t have gotten back to the apartment fast enough. Now that I thought I had an answer, I needed to try it out. I knew I wasn’t going to get any sleep if I didn’t.

&#x200B;

I didn’t have any paints or canvases. It wasn’t going to be perfect. But it didn’t need to be. A pencil and paper would do just fine… They’d been more than enough in the past. I found a loose piece of paper from one of my school binders when I got back to my bedroom. The Unicorn Prince watched me from his painting, as if he was wondering what I’d do and his attention remained fixated on me as I found a pencil and began my sketch.

&#x200B;

It had been so long since I’d done this… The first few lines were rough. I needed to erase them and redo them. But I had done this before so many times, that it came back to me quickly. I remembered the thrill I’d felt when I’d drawn like this so many years ago, the simple joy of filling a blank space with something beautiful. I remembered what it felt like when I saw the finished work move for the first time…

&#x200B;

By the time I’d finished drawing her face, I’d started thinking of her as ‘Annabelle’. It was a name that had popped into my head. I envisioned her hair, long and greenish with algae that gave her an ethereal look. I imagined that the scales of her tail would shimmer a dull lavender, although I didn’t have any way to color them. She was beautiful, even amongst the mermaids. But most importantly… She could speak. She could tell me what was wrong! She could communicate with me!

&#x200B;

I took everything I wanted for her, and I put it into that sketch, the same way I’d done when I was younger. It took me longer than it had before… The minutes crept into hours. My eyelids felt heavy, but I knew my mind wouldn’t accept sleep until this was finished. I left her background mostly bare, save for a few distant reeds in the water behind her. She wasn’t perfect. Far from it. I was out of practice.

&#x200B;

But by the time I set my pencil down, she was good enough. I stared down at the sketch I’d just made, watching Annabelle for some sign of movement. At first, there was nothing. For a moment, I was almost sure that I’d somehow lost whatever I’d had before and I felt a growing panic starting to gnaw inside my stomach.

&#x200B;

Then I saw the reeds swaying in the current behind her. Her hair bobbed around her head. Her eyes were moving.

&#x200B;

She was alive.

&#x200B;

I stared down at her, feeling a familiar elation. It had worked!  Annabelles tail swished back and forth, her head shifted, scanning her surroundings before focusing on me.

“Annabelle, can you hear me?” I asked. I wondered if she’d recognize her own name. Judging by the shift in her expression, she did. I wasn’t expecting what happened next, though.

&#x200B;

Like the overflow from a cup, cold water began to spill out from the paper I’d sketched on. The paper itself remained immaculate, untouched by the water, which dribbled off my desk and into my lap. I shot backward, knocking my chair over as I recoiled.  This was new. I’d never had a sketch… bleed, before.

&#x200B;

The water poured off my desk in greater volumes, leaving a massive puddle on the floor. I swore under my breath and looked for a towel. But before I could see one, I saw something moving off of the page. A hand, reaching out off the paper and clinging to my desk. Webbed fingers struggled to find purchase before pressing against my desk. A second arm reached out of the sketch, and a fresh flood of water poured off my desk.

&#x200B;

I stood stock still, frozen as I watched Annabelle lift herself out of the sketch. Her head came next, rising off the page and spilling more cold seawater onto my floor. Her mouth opened as if to gasp in the air around her, and her eyes darted around wildly. On paper, she’d looked wonderful… But off of it.

&#x200B;

The imperfections of her face seemed more jarring and uncanny. Her eyes were too large. Her pupils moved too much and her mouth was too big. She looked at me, sloshing water off my desk as she moved. Her wet, pencil-drawn hair clung to her head in a way that seemed unnatural.

&#x200B;

And then she spoke.

*“You…”*

&#x200B;

Her voice was weak as if the very act of speaking was difficult. She sounded as if she were struggling to breathe. I stumbled backward towards my bedroom door, my feet soaked by the pool of water forming in my room. I couldn’t get away fast enough, though. An arm shot out towards me, grabbing me by the wrist.

&#x200B;

*“No!”* I screamed, but I couldn’t pull away. She was stronger than I was. Unfathomably so. She almost ripped my arm off as she jerked me towards her.

*“Not leaving again…”* She rasped, *“You’re not leaving us again…”*

*“Let go of me!”*

*“No.”*

&#x200B;

Annabelle's other hand grabbed me by the shoulder as she sank back into her sketch and I realized that she was going to take me with her. I struggled, with everything I had in me I struggled and screamed. I kicked and thrashed but I couldn’t get free of her!

*“You’ll be safe…”* She rasped, *“Safe where you belong...”*

*“No!”*

&#x200B;

I was crying again, screaming my last defiance as Annabelle forced me down towards the sketch with her.

*“No! No! No! Stop it! NO!”*

My final scream was cut off as she pulled me down into the sketch with her.

&#x200B;

Cold water surrounded me and filled my lungs. The world around me seemed impossibly white, just like the paper I’d sketched her onto. Swaying reeds, drawn in pencil sat beneath us, inviting me to a watery grave. Annabelle just smiled sweetly at me, her imperfect features giving her a grin that was far too large.

&#x200B;

My head was immersed in the water, and I could feel my shoulders being pulled down as well.

*‘I’m going to die like this…’* I remember thinking, and unlike last time I was not okay with it.

Annabelle pulled me deeper and deeper. Her tranquil smile never faded. One of her hands came up to caress my cheek. I inhaled the water and felt it filling my lungs. I was drowning. Oh God, I was actually drowning! I still tried to fight, but I knew it wasn’t going to matter. Not anymore.

&#x200B;

I was vaguely aware of the sensation of hands around my waist and the sensation of someone pulling me back the other way. I saw Annebelles' expression sour although I wasn’t sure if she was confused or angry. Maybe both.

&#x200B;

Something jerked me back in the other direction. Her grip on me slipped as I was pulled away from her. She reached out to grab me again, only to have me ripped out of her reach. Suddenly, I was pulled out of the water. Through my blurred vision, I recognized the walls of my own bedroom.

&#x200B;

“Megan! Megan, talk to me! Meg, please! C’mon…”

I coughed, spitting up the water I’d swallowed. I felt sick to my stomach and I didn’t recognize the voice that was calling to me at first.

“C’mon… You’re alright. You’re alright…”

I blinked. Through my water smeared glasses, I recognized Jane sitting over me, a clear concern on her face. Her hand was warm against my cheek.

“There we go. You’re alright!” She said, although her voice was shaking. I’d never heard her sound so terrified before in my life. “You’re alright… You’re alright…”

&#x200B;

From my desk behind her, I could see Annabelle rising up from the sketch again. I weakly tried to gesture to her so Jane would notice. She glanced over her shoulder, her eyes widening as she saw the mermaid rise up to take me back.

*“She belongs with us…”* Annabelle hissed as she loomed over Jane, impossibly large. She just stared up at it, frozen in fear for a moment. Annabelle reached out, her slimy hand closing around Jane’s throat.

*“With us…”*

She was going to kill her. I knew that… and I couldn’t let it happen. Not to Jane.

&#x200B;

The pencil I’d used for my sketch had been washed off my desk and had rolled beside my bed. On instinct, I grabbed it and forced myself to my feet. I don’t know what I was thinking. I didn’t even know if it was going to work… But I couldn’t let her hurt Jane.

&#x200B;

My body seemed to move on auto pilot as I stabbed the pencil into Annabelle’s eye. She let out an agonized screech as her body tensed up. Her hand left Jane’s neck as she pressed it against her new wound.

&#x200B;

Then, she sank back down into the sketch. The water she’d displaced with her coming seemed to roll back with her and cascaded back into the paper. Her final scream still seemed to echo as she retreated but in just a matter of seconds… She was gone. The sketch had changed. Instead of a tranquil mermaid, floating in a sea of reeds, Annabelle looked to be writhing in pain. I could still see her moving and twitching.

&#x200B;

I knew she was going to try and come again.

&#x200B;

I grabbed the paper and ripped it apart. Annabelles last scream still seemed to echo faintly… But in a few moments, all was silent.

&#x200B;

My room was mostly dry, although my hair was still wet. Jane sank down onto my bed, panting heavily and I looked over at her. She looked pale as a ghost.

“A-are you alright?” I managed to stammer. She didn’t respond at first. Her hand rubbed against her neck, where Annabelle had grabbed her. After a moment, she nodded.

“Yeah… Yeah, I’m good… What about you?”

“I’m okay…”

“What the hell was that thing? One of your old sketches?”

&#x200B;

I was reluctant to answer, but I couldn’t keep her in the dark.

“That one was new… I-I thought… I thought maybe I could communicate with them… Talk to them somehow, you know?”

I half expected Jane to get mad. I’m still not sure why she didn’t.

“Oh… Well, it could’ve gone better!”

I couldn’t argue with that.

&#x200B;

We burned the sketch of Annabelle. I think that was for the best… I slept in Jane’s bed that night. It was easier to sleep when I wasn’t alone.

&#x200B;

My first attempt to communicate with my creations was a failure… But I’ve talked to Jane. I think I approached this the wrong way. I tried to make something new. Something unpredictable. I should have expected things to go wrong. But maybe if I try again, maybe if I use something more… trustworthy. Maybe that might work.

&#x200B;

[I was already thinking about fixing the Unicorn Prince. All I need is some fresh paint and a canvas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/m4unri/they_call_me_spacegirl_i_tried_to_communicate/)
