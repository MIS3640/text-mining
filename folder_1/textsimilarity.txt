 I was standing alone on a dark street in the middle of the night, wearing only my pink silk pajamas and stuffy sloth slippers, holding a Louisville Slugger in one hand and Li’l Doodles in the other, when my world turned upside down. 

“You’re saying,” I mumbled, the words violating my larynx like sandpaper, “[that a man pretended to be a cop when he came into my home last week](https://redd.it/m3gow8)?”

The phone clicked momentarily before the 911 operator’s voice muffled the sound. “That’s exactly what I’m saying, Olivia.”

“And that there’s… no police record of the man who’s been living in the hidden room in my house? I’ve been sleeping there for a week, assuming the cops were keeping an eye on me, while he was-” I dry heaved before catching my breath again. “While he was adding to his pile of crusty tissues?”

I wobbled and nearly fell onto the grass.

“And he’s probably watching me right now, because I just saw a light turn on in my house while I’m standing outside?”

He cleared his throat. “Do you live alone, Olivia?”

I nodded before realizing that he couldn’t see me. My brain felt like it was spit-roasting three feet above my hair. “Yes, I – I’m alone. At least I thought I was.”

“Okay,” he responded quickly, “we have a car heading out to pick you up right now. Just stay where you are. Your house number is 1913, correct?”

The first hints of relief washed through me. I relaxed my grip on the bat, but it felt distant, like I was watching someone else’s arm. “That’s right. I’m here now. Please hurry.”

“We are hurrying. Just don’t go anywhere, okay?” Even he sounded slightly on edge. 

“Would it be a good idea for me to move away from the house? I’m pretty sure he’s inside-”

“No,” he interrupted, “we need you to stay where we can find you.”

“Oh.” I felt lightheaded. “Okay, I’ll – I’ll stay right here.”

Calmness slowly pulled my brain back down to earth, reeling it in like a gently tethered balloon. Strange as this was, we were going to straighten it out. I didn’t know what was going on, but holy *shit* - thank every one of Zeus’s nipples that it hadn’t been too late.

I’d been so *sure* that the cop was real. It chilled me to the liver when I considered just how convincing he’d been. 

The man last week had played it so *calm*, like he didn’t actually give a shit. How was I supposed to recognize a fake police officer when I met him? 

My breath stopped. Not metaphorically – I actually ceased breathing from fear.

“Olivia? Can you hear me?”

How was I supposed to know which was fake, and which was real? 

“The car is almost there, Olivia.”

All I knew is that one of the two had mostly ignored me, while the other was contacting me through a phone immediately after Dad had used that phone to tell me to run.

And that message had been coded, because he clearly thought that someone was listening in. 

Headlights appeared at the end of my street. The car raced toward me.

No one else was around. 

I lowered a shaking hand, holding the phone by my side. 

The car screeched to a halt directly in front of me. 

And I breathed. It was a cop car. That can’t be faked, can it? It would be much easier to pull together an imposter’s uniform than to steal a police cruiser. *This* person had to be the legit one.

I relaxed slightly. 

A tall, thin man hopped out of the driver’s seat. He, too, was dressed like a cop. 

I made a split decision. Who to trust? The lazy cop who did nothing to help me? Or the one connected to a 911 service and driving an authentic car?

“Olivia?” he asked, stepping out to approach me, leaving his keys behind with the engine running.

“Yes,” I answered, relieved.

His pocket echoed. 

Oh, no. 

It echoed with *my* voice. 

I hadn’t been talking to a 911 operator at all. This man had been speaking to me through his cell phone as he drove to find me – a phone that was now in his pocket. 

911 operators don’t have to be so concerned about locations that they can gather through cell pings. 

“I need you to come with me,” he explained authoritatively.

I nodded and slid the phone into my pocket.

Then I tossed Doodles right to him. The man reached out in surprise and caught the stuffed dog, which is the natural human reaction when something flies at your head. This momentarily exposed his torso. I jabbed the bat’s handle forcefully into his gut. He doubled over and wheezed, then bent down in front of me, clutching his stomach. It was the perfect angle for me to bring the Louisville Slugger down on his skull. 

*CRACK*

It sounded like a hammer made of fingernails carving a frozen, dusty chalkboard. He collapsed, and I stepped over him. My hand was on the door’s handle when I stopped cold. 

Turning around, I could see that he was still conscious, but writhing in pain on the ground.

I quickly moved back to him, hoping the sloth slippers muffled my footsteps. Raising the bat high, I bent down and snatched Doodles from his chest. “Thanks,” I whispered to the stuffed dog. 

Then I raced for the police car’s open door, threw Doodles and the bat onto to seat next to mine, shut it behind me, and threw it into drive. 

Damn, cop cars are *powerful.*

I spun an erratic 180 before punching the gas and heading down the street. I glanced at the rearview mirror just before turning the corner.

The man lay, unmoving, beneath a streetlight. 

I let out a deep, shuddering sigh of relief. 

“Hello, Olivia,” came [a voice from the back seat](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

[Expand](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)Sleeping in my bed always used to make me itchy. It was an annoyingly predictable cycle. I would fall asleep with an odd, tickling sensation on my skin, one that would vanish when I rubbed at the spot. And when I woke up, my arms and legs would be crazy itchy, almost burning.

I once sat in the bathroom for almost thirty minutes, looking over my skin with a hand mirror, my butt slowly going numb, obsessively examining every spot. But there was nothing I could pinpoint.

My dad scoffed at my problem. He was frustratingly skeptical of just about everything, and every time I complained to him, he would shrug it off and suggest another fruitless solution I had already tried. Truth be told, I think he just hated hearing anything bad about the house. It was been in his family for generations, and he was always reticent to change anything about it.

I sometimes wondered if my bed had been in the family for generations too. It creaked if you so much as looked at it, and had all sorts of lumpy spots. And it smelled permanently musty, no matter how much air freshener I hosed it down with or how many times I washed the sheets. It rubbed off onto my skin, oozed into my pores. My friends always joked that I smelled like their grandparents’ houses.

At first I thought it might just be something weird with my skin. But then one time, my cousins came to visit. One got my bed and I was banished to the couch. At first I was upset, but that visit was the first time I could remember that my skin didn’t itch when I woke up. The morning that my cousins were leaving, I approached the one that had slept in my bed.

“Hey, did you sleep alright in my room?”

“Yeah,” she said, “I slept fine.”

“And no weird… reactions?”

She cocked her head. “Now that I think about it, I always woke up really itchy.”

“Oh?”

“Yeah…” She brushed a hand over her bare arm. “It felt like something was… tickling me just as I was falling asleep. Once, I turned on the lights, and checked the bed, but I didn’t see anything. Well, probably nothing.”

“Probably?”

“Yeah. I mean, I might have…” She trailed off, then shook her head. “No, nothing.”

So it was the bed. It was the damned bed. I begged my dad to replace it, but he always refused.  

“Why replace a perfectly good bed?” he’d ask me.

So I slathered my skin in anti-itch cream, tried not to scratch myself raw, and got on with my life.

One day though, I had had enough. When my parents weren’t home, I attempted to break the bed. I jumped up and down on it as high as I could, feeling like a giant five year old, sure that my dad would have to replace a broken bed.

But as I stopped and rested for a moment, a sharp pain shot into my foot, like a needle jamming into my leg. I cried out and fell onto the bed, clutching my foot. The spot was bleeding lightly. I must have jammed a box spring into my leg or something. I looked down at the spot I had jumped on.

It wasn’t hard to spot. There was a small splotch of blood there, and I could see the spring sticking up, a little black speck. I lightly touched the spot, wondering if I could push it back down.

Then it moved. Beneath my finger, it slid back under the surface without any pressure on my part. I thought I might have felt the skittering movement of... something, like a sea creature returning to the depths.

I scrambled back and reexamined the spot. Nothing. Just my blood now. I swallowed hard and tried to rationalize. The spring must have just… sprung back into shape, right? Yeah, that sounded realistic.

My foot had already stopped bleeding. I decided I was done with this endeavor, and left the room, unable to stop my skin from crawling.

That night the tingling was worst that before. I tossed and turned, certain I had angered the spirit of this accursed bed. And then the pain began. This was nothing like before. It was like pins were stabbing me all over my body. I flung my blanket aside and leaped up, fleeing down the stairs and waking my parents. And when my dad flipped on the lights, demanding to know what was happening, I saw it.

My skin was covered in strange, black smears, and painful bumps. I tried to talk, but all I could do was cry, my skin burned so bad. Even my father could not think of a good way to explain this. I ended up in the shower for ages, trying to cool my angry skin with icy water.

The one good thing to come out of this incident was that I was finally getting a new mattress. My parents took me to buy one the very next morning. I was elated. It was dead simple, my dad picked one out, we strapped it to the roof of the car, and drove home.

I helped haul it up to my room, squeezing it through the narrow door. I glared down the horrible old mattress that had tormented me for so long and scratched idly at the bumps still on my skin.

“Alright,” my dad said, clapping his hands together, “Let’s get moving!” We heaved the mattress out of the bed frame and it hit the ground upside down with a thump. I could see that the bottom had a sheet of gauze covering it, the staples holding it in place rusted almost to nothingness.

To this day, I have no idea what possessed me to do this. Maybe, looking down at the bed, seemingly defeated, I wanted to see what had allowed it to torment me for so long. Maybe it was a childish instinct to harm it in some way. But I reached down and tugged at the gauze.

It came away easily. And at first, I did not quite understand what my eyes were seeing. The inside was coated in a fuzzy black and white substance. Mold, I thought, of course it was mold. But then the mass moved and I realized in horror what it really was.

Spiders. Hundreds and hundreds of huge pitch black spiders and their fuzzy white egg sacs. They began to swarm out of the old mattress like flies deserting a rotting corpse.

I screamed and leaped onto the side table. But it was no use. They crawled onto my bare legs, biting and biting, and I desperately tried to shake them off.

My dad tried to stomp on them, but there were just too many. They coated the floor almost as thick as carpet. Finally, he sprang across the room and hefted me over his shoulder. He stampeded down the stairs, ran out the back, and leapt into the pool, mercifully ending their attack.

As we surfaced, I could see them floating on the surface of the water, either curled up and twitching in their death spasms, or skittering away on the surface to elsewhere.

We called an exterminator, insisting they had to come that day. The whole house was fumigated while we stayed in a hotel and I tried not to twitch in my bed, desperately trying to reassure myself that I was just imagining tiny legs tickling my skin.

Before the exterminators left for good, I asked if they had ever seen anything like this before.

“Once,” one said, scratching at his salt and pepper stubble. “Not as bad as this, but I’ve seen it.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. Another old box spring.” He chuckled. “Makes you wonder what’s really under people’s beds.”

Makes you wonder indeed.It’s Eli. Okay, great, got that out of the way. Now the good stuff.

You know how I [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lzwof4/my_city_has_been_cut_off_from_the_world_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that I intended to find out what the hell Tristan’s deal was? Well, good news: I did. Bad news: he still won’t tell us the part that would actually be SUPER HELPFUL, because he’s being an ass.

Here’s how it’s been going. He’s still staying at the bookstore, and even Zoe isn’t a big fan of his anymore. We’ve given him one of the extra storage rooms upstairs to sleep in; we brought in a sleeping bag and the two pillows Waffles doesn’t like and everything. At first, I tried talking about a lot of my good memories with Nolan, but that honestly seemed to make things worse, because Tristan always found a way to twist them into my bad influence on his brother or how annoying we’d been acting from his point of view. 

Yeah, he’s kind of a buzzkill.

I’ve tried not to let it get to me when he makes his hatred of me clear, but it’s hard. He’s never liked me; he *says* it’s because of the bad influence thing, but Nolan and I were always pretty well-behaved, even as teenagers. We snuck out a few times, went to parties occasionally, but we didn’t do anything crazy. Definitely nothing that would brand me as a bad influence. Maybe it goes all the way back to kindergarten when I hit Nolan in the head with a doll. Maybe *that’s* what he means. 

Either way, what I’m trying to say is that Tristan disliking me isn’t anything new. But I’ve tried not to hold it against him; I always made jokes with him and started conversations when I was over at Nolan’s house. (Come to think of it, that might’ve made him hate me more…oops). Still, I think it’s gotten worse. I swear to God, he’s giving me a constant death glare for about eight hours a day. I don’t know how his facial muscles are strong enough to hold that much focused hatred, but damn, they sure are. It’s his signature expression: the Death Glare™.

After a day or two of Tristan shooting down my efforts, Zoe had shifted her opinion of him too. As we crawled under the blankets on the second night and she took off her glasses, she said, “I really tried giving him the benefit of the doubt, but he kind of sucks. He’s such a dick to you. The way he acts, you’d think *you* murdered Nolan.”

“I know,” I said, settling on the mattress beside her. “He’s always been like that. What’s the opposite of a fan? Because he’s the president of that club.”

“Maybe he’s just jealous that Nolan likes you better than him,” she said sleepily. 

“Maybe,” I agreed. Then she scooted over and laid her head on my chest, and Mr. Bailey curled up against my leg, so Tristan being an asshole suddenly seemed like a much less important problem.

And yet, he’s still here. Why he wants to be is anyone’s guess. Honestly, I think he was hurt in the massacre more than he wants to admit and knows he’ll be killed if he goes off on his own. I see him wince when he moves. 

His presence here means that some of our conversation practices have gotten weirder. Zoe and I talk privately in the soundproof room most of the time; whenever we talk to him in the bookstore, we make sure it’s nothing important about our next moves or plans. But that means that we have to invite him into the soundproof room with us when we want to interrogate him, and I don’t think a single one of us is a fan of that.

It took four days to find out what he was hiding from us. Four days of jabs at me, insults, pointed silence. It was really great. (That was sarcasm, in case my meaning wasn’t clear through text. It was not a pleasant experience). You know, as awesome as Nolan was/is – I’m holding out hope for the *is* – you’d really think his brother would be less of a pain. But no.

And look, I get it. He’s never liked me anyway, he got swallowed by a bear, he’s worried about Nolan. But it’s not like I’ve had an easy life in the past year either, and I’d like to find Nolan just as much as Tristan would. So, I think he needs to get over himself. 

But I digress. On that day, Zoe, Tristan and I were all in the soundproof room. Zoe and I were sitting on the mattress, and Tristan had taken my old spot in the desk chair. He was mostly brooding and silent, giving me his steady Death Glare™ while Zoe and I talked. That is, until we reached our daily topic of searching for the elevator. Like he had every day before that when we started our escape discussions, Tristan let his Death Glare™ slip for just a second, and that same flash of knowing something and considering saying something but deciding not to appeared. It infuriated me every time, because I’d always point it out, and Tristan would simply tell me to fuck off. 

Not wanting to break tradition, when I saw his expression shift, I said, “Hey Tristan, what do you know that you’re not telling us?”

He immediately responded with the usual, “Fuck off,” but this time it seemed more forced. He also didn’t put back on the Death Glare™ mask right away; he actually seemed to be mulling something over. I could practically see the gears turning in his head.

After a few seconds of silence, I figured he’d decided against it. I sighed and said, “Okay, well, it’s probably more likely to be in the –”

“I think I know where it is,” Tristan interrupted. His voice was quiet but firm. Zoe and I both stared at him in shock. “The elevator. I think I saw it,” he continued.

Then, on that cliffhanger, he fucking paused. I waited for him to add on, but apparently that was as far as he was getting without prompting. “Well, where the hell is it?” I exclaimed.

“You know, Nolan and I listened to our parents die,” he said. He sounded more dazed now, like he was letting his mind drift to the faraway reaches he hadn’t been to in a while. If he was repressing his traumas as much as I was, he probably hadn’t. His eyes, too, seemed to be looking at something far in the distance. 

I turned to look at Zoe and threw my hands up in a universal *What the fuck is this!?* gesture, but she simply shrugged and held a finger to her lips. She was probably right; maybe if we just let him talk, he’d get to the point. As much as I didn’t want to hear about Nolan’s parents (RIP Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, you were great) or whatever Nolan may have suffered, I could handle it, and I *did* want to hear about Tristan’s possible knowledge of the elevator. If he was telling the truth, that info was worth the wait.

“I was sleeping when it started, because I’d worked the overnight shift at IHOP, like every Friday. My parents were downstairs, having coffee in the kitchen. It was Saturday, after all. Nolan was home for the weekend from college; you know that. He was gonna hang out with you later that day,” Tristan said, looking at me, although I wasn’t sure he was actually seeing me. “God, I wish he hadn’t come home that weekend. If he wasn’t in the city, he’d be fine now.” He sighed heavily, almost shakily.

“Tristan’s lived with their parents and worked different jobs since he graduated high school five years ago,” I whispered to Zoe. “First Pizza Hut, then Staples, now IHOP. Nolan went to college a few hours away and came home about once or twice a month. We would always meet up when he visited.”

Zoe nodded but didn’t take her eyes off Tristan, who seemed to be gearing up to speak again. 

“I didn’t hear any of the first part. I’m a pretty heavy sleeper,” he said. “But suddenly Nolan was shaking me awake violently. I started to yell at him and ask him what the fuck he thought he was doing, but he slapped a hand over my mouth and told me to be quiet. Before I could protest or bite him – because I was going to – he hissed at me that he’d heard crashes and screams downstairs. He’d been in his room and started running for the stairs, to go down and help our parents, but dad yelled, ‘BOYS, HIDE! DON’T COME DOWN HERE!’ and Nolan said he sounded both so authoritative and so scared that Nolan *had* to listen. 

“By then I was pretty awake, obviously. I could hear muffled crashes and scuffling from downstairs, but it was hard to determine what they were, because Nolan was frantically whispering over and over that we had to stay quiet, we had to hide, and after a minute or so I shoved him off and said, ‘Okay, okay, fine, come on.’ I didn’t totally believe him. I kinda thought he was trying to prank me. But I figured I’d give him the benefit of the doubt and play along for at least a few minutes. Just in case it was real.”

I couldn’t resist. “You *asshole,*” I said. “Nolan was terrified, and you thought he was pranking you?”

His eyes cleared, and he looked at me with the kind of venom generally reserved for looking at serial killers or people who kick puppies. “It wouldn’t be the first time,” he defended himself. “When you two were together, you used to –”

“I wasn’t even there!” I exploded. “And we would *never* do anything like that! Our pranks were, like, sending you texts from fake subscription services! Nothing that would ever mess with emotions or drag your parents in!”

Zoe put a hand on my shoulder. “Calm down,” she said quietly. “It’s not worth it. Don’t you want to hear what he knows?” To Tristan, she raised her voice and said, “He didn’t mean it. About your parents and Nolan…you were saying?”

Tristan gave me one final Death Glare™, but at Zoe’s words, he seemed to remember that he did actually want to talk about his trauma. Maybe it was therapeutic for him. Probably he was imagining he was just talking to Zoe, and that I wasn’t here at all.

“Anyway, if you’ll *let me talk* now, I was saying that Nolan and I hurried into my closet. We crawled back behind my shoes, closed the door, and crouched there together in the dark corner. We didn’t really fit. I told him to scoot over, and he whispered that he couldn’t. His voice was shaking.

“That’s when I began to believe him, because once we were quiet, I could hear what was happening downstairs better. There was some weird howl-screech sound that sent shivers down my spine, more crashes, my parents yelling. I swear I even heard distant singing. It all made my head hurt. At first it sounded like my parents were fighting, but then the screams were full of pain. Nolan looked at me in the dark, and he whispered, ‘We have to go help them. Is it a break-in? We can get dad’s gun from the office. We have to help them!’ and I said, ‘No. We can’t.’

“I held him back. He struggled at first, but after a minute or two, he quieted down. He was crying quietly into my shirt. As we sat there and he cried, the sounds faded. The screams cut off in a horrible way that definitely meant bad news, and the crashes ceased. I heard heavy footsteps, and then it was quiet.”

He paused again, and I could have sworn his eyes were wet, though no tears fell. Even Tristan couldn’t be a dick when he was remembering his parents’ death. Say what you will about his relationship to me, but he did care about his family, especially his parents. This time I said nothing, because a sense of dread had settled over me; hearing about Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds’ death was stirring up all the awful memories of my own family’s deaths. And in my case, I hadn’t just listened to it – I’d *watched* them happen.

(Honestly, though, I wasn’t feeling as unstable as usual thinking about that horrible day, so maybe my mental health really is improving. If that’s true, I guess I have Zoe to thank for that).

Tristan took a deep breath and continued. “I pushed Nolan away and said, ‘Stay here. I’m going down to look’ and he grabbed my arm and told me he was coming too. So, I went and grabbed my dad’s gun, and then we started slowly down the stairs.

“It was eerily quiet. We’d only made it down the first few steps before we saw the blood spatters on the walls. There were literally sprays of blood across our family photos hanging by the stairs. The smell was terrible. We stepped down into the living room, and there were blood and body parts and glass pieces everywhere. Nolan started crying again when he saw it. 

“There were no bodies, though. ‘The kitchen,’ I said. Nolan shook his head but followed me. I wasn’t wearing any shoes, and in just a few steps, my feet were slick with blood and cut up with glass shards. It was worse than stepping on Legos.”

Apparently, this was a joke, because he looked up at us expectantly. Zoe caught on quicker than I did and gave a little laugh; I just stared at him. He rolled his eyes at me – it was specifically at *me,* I could tell – and looked back at Zoe before continuing.

“The kitchen was awful. My dad’s body were there – well, whatever wasn’t on the walls and spread across the living room, anyway. The back door was open, with a trail of blood leading out there. I followed it, and from the doorway I could see my mom’s body on the patio. It was less torn apart than my dad’s, but there was still a lot of blood. And her head was…gone. I think it exploded, because I’m pretty sure I saw bits of brain matter on the bushes. 

“Suddenly from behind me, Nolan yelled, ‘TRISTAN!’ and I spun around to see some tall, skinless thing climbing through the shattered front window. I raised the gun and started firing, but I only hit its torso, and that didn’t slow it down too much. ‘The eyes! Its eyes look weird! Try those!’ Nolan shouted, scrambling halfway up the stairs.

“The thing kept coming, and it let out that screech I’d heard earlier. I don’t know if it had just left our house but saw us moving around in there, or if it was still there the whole time. But now it started charging towards me. I aimed more carefully and shot for its eyes. I was just hoping Nolan’s hunch was right.”

“It was,” I said quietly. “Nolan always was great at noticing details. He was gonna study microbiology or genetics or something super science-y like that. He would’ve been a kickass scientist.”

Zoe reached out and squeezed my hand. Tristan gave me the signature Death Glare™. “I know,” he said. “He was always the smarter kid of the two of us.”

“Doesn’t take much,” I muttered under my breath. Zoe dug her nails in to my hand and raised her eyebrows at me; she was clearly telling me to shut up and stop provoking him. I rolled my eyes but stayed silent, because to be honest, I did want to hear where this was going and how it circled back to him supposedly knowing about the elevator.

“Anyway, I aimed and shot for its eyes – or the hole where its eye would have been. And *that* worked. The thing screeched and fell to its side. Some kind of thick, purple liquid oozed down its face. I shot again, aiming for its other eye and then for its neck, and after both those shots, it finally stopped moving and laid there on the kitchen floor next to my dad.

“Nolan and I just kind of stared at each other in shock. ‘What the hell *are* they?’ he asked. ‘I have no idea,’ I said. Out the window, we heard more screams and roars and howls; I saw glimpses of people running by, of creatures I’d never seen before in the street. I was afraid one of them might see us through the window, so I grabbed Nolan’s arm and pulled him upstairs. We went into my parents’ bedroom, pulled down all the blinds and curtains, and turned on the TV. 

“The local news was showing footage of monsters and bodies and a giant dome, which they said had cut off the city. Lines of cars stretched down the highway trying to get out; it was literally broadcast live as monsters mowed them down like they were blades of grass. Then the news helicopter was hit by something, I guess, because there were screams, and then the screen went to static.

“I turned it off and we sat there in silence. ‘What the fuck is happening? Why here?’ Nolan asked. ‘I don’t know,’ I told him. ‘But we can’t get out of the city. So we’ll have to manage here.’

“‘It’s like the apocalypse,’ he said. I didn’t have a response to that. We just packed up our bags and prepared to leave. We spent the night there, but we didn’t feel safe with the destroyed downstairs, and we didn’t want to stay there with our parents’ bodies. It made Nolan start to cry again every time we had to cross the kitchen to get food. So we left the next morning.”

“I just missed you, then,” I said. “I tried to come find Nolan, you know. I went to your house on the second day, and several times after that. I saw your parents. But I never saw any signs of you.”

He didn’t miss a beat, the asshole. “In that case, thank God we left,” he said. “Nolan was better off than me than he would’ve been with you.”

“I don’t know,” I retorted. “*I’m* not the one who got eaten by a Mike. I’ve been surviving the whole time.”

“That’s *enough,* boys*,*” interjected Zoe. 

Tristan shot me yet another Death Glare™ and said, “Well, after that, we spent the next few months moving around, killing monsters, staying alive. It won’t surprise you to know that Nolan, despite everything, thought the monsters were fascinating. He always said that if the situation were different, if he could’ve looked at them in a lab, he would’ve loved to study their biology. But I wasn’t about to let him drag in a monster body off the street to look at.”

“It could’ve helped you fight them if you knew more about them,” offered Zoe gently.

Tristan frowned at her. “Yeah, but I wasn’t about to bring one of them home with us. What if any of them reanimated and killed us in our sleep? Not to mention the fact that Nolan noticed a camera in one of their bodies pretty early on. Once we knew about the cameras, even Nolan agreed we shouldn’t be messing with the monsters more than we had to.

“He was still good at finding their weaknesses, though. We were a great team,” he said thoughtfully. “He studied them when he could and figured out how to kill them, and I handled the actual killing. You know, I think those couple of months were the best we’d gotten along since we were kids. Just us against the world. No one else.” He shot me an accusatory look. Seems like Zoe may have been on to something with that jealousy thing.

Tristan also *still* hadn’t mentioned anything about the elevator, and I was getting antsy. Was it a lie so that he had an excuse to keep our attention while talking through his traumas? Did he just want to get our hopes up and then crush them? I wouldn’t put it past him.

“What about the elevator?” I prompted. 

Tristan sighed. “I think I saw it the day before we ran across the bear. We were out on a supply run, and I insisted on going a different way than we’d planned. It made Nolan nervous and he said we should stick to the plan, but there were a lot of monsters along that route. I told him we were switching paths, and he could either come with me or I’d leave him behind. After a while he followed me.

“But then I heard a lot of growling and kind of a mechanical squealing from this building, and I peeked inside to investigate, and I saw a room open up, with big sliding door like an elevator. I mean, I didn’t think of it an as elevator at the time, but that *is* what it looked like. And monsters poured out of it. The elevator must have been wall-to-wall packed. Once the room was empty, the doors closed…and I heard the whirring as the elevator went back down. 

“I wanted to go look closer right then, but Nolan was freaking out. He kept saying that he *told* me we shouldn’t have come this way, look what we’d stumbled into. I said, ‘It might be a way out!’ and he said, ‘We can’t know that without studying it more. We can’t just run into it! We have to watch first and only go when we know it’s safe. That’s what you made me do when mom and dad died, remember? You were right then and I’m right now.’

“Of course I listened. He’s the smart one. But when we tried to go back the next day…well, that’s when the bear got me.” Tristan shook his head. “It was the first time Nolan got a guess wrong. We’d never met one of those fuckers before. As soon as we met it, Nolan froze and whispered, ‘It must hunt by sight. Look at its giant eyes.’”

I was nodding as he said this, because if *I* had managed to put that together during my first encounter with a Mike, there’s no way Nolan hadn’t. 

“Then he said, ‘It must have blind spots. I bet it’s like a horse. Can’t see a short distance directly in front of it, or directly behind it. We just have to get close enough to get in its blind spots, and the rest is easy.’ That sounded legitimate to me – he’d never been wrong before – but I still wanted to protect him best I could. He is my little brother. So, I volunteered for the front blind spot, since that seemed riskier, and I told him to take the back.

“It was waiting – it had seen us move right before we froze. We both took off sprinting at the same time, in opposite directions. As soon as it pursued me, I turned around to run right back towards it, hoping that I could get into the blind spot between its eyes and kill it. Nolan immediately turned around, too, and started coming up behind it; I couldn’t see him, but I heard him. 

“The bear’s breath was hot and heavy. I raised the gun and aimed for its eyes – but the eyes never left me. There *wasn’t* a blind spot. I tried to fire, but it swatted the gun right out of my hand like it was light as a feather. And I didn’t have time to do anything else before it lunged forward and pinned me to the ground. Then the mouth opened wider and wider, and the black hole started to drag me in…” He trailed off, shivering. I’d never seen Tristan look so vulnerable, not even when he was covered in blood back at the scene of the massacre.

“I kept hoping Nolan would be able to kill it as I was sucked into the darkness. I heard him trying: there were gunshots, and he was calling, ‘I’ll save you, Tristan!’, sounding more and more desperate. But then the noises were gone, and there was nothing but empty blackness. 

“I thought it got him too, but he must have escaped somehow. I don’t think he killed it, since I had to wait for *you* to free me,” he said with disdain, looking at me. “But maybe he at least had the common sense to freeze and wait it out when he realized he couldn’t kill it. Maybe it got away and he’s been looking for it since.”

He finally went silent, and it seemed he was done for good this time. I was silent for a minute too, thinking. I’d worried the same thing when I was facing the Mike to save Zoe. It chilled my blood to think that the exact fear I’d had about never being able to find the same Mike again may have been a reality for my best friend.

But then there was still the fucking elevator. Tristan had been intentionally vague when describing that part. No mention of a specific location. If he thought I’d missed that, he was insane. I may not be as good with details as Nolan, but a blind man could’ve noticed the gaping holes in *that* story.

“What about the elevator?” I asked again. “Don’t you think that’s our best bet at getting out of here?”

Tristan gave me – you guessed it – the certified Death Glare™ and said, “Maybe. But I don’t care. I don’t want to help you. I just want to find Nolan.”

I threw my hands up in frustration. “Yeah, but so do I! You may not like it, but I’m at least as close to him as you ever were. We’ll help search for him if you tell us where the goddamn elevator is. Don’t you want to get out of this hellscape too?”

The asshole had the audacity to smirk at me. That’s when I realized: he was enjoying this. He was taking pleasure in the fact that he had leverage over me. You know how I said I don’t hate him? Yeah, I might be taking that back.

“Fine, I’ll tell you,” he said, still smirking. His eyes never left mine. “On one condition. I want to talk to you, Eli. Alone.”I had known Marissa forever. We were inseparable ever since we were children, and living right next door to each other made it so that we could see each other all the time.

Then, as we grew older, our friendship grew into something more. We fell in love. But it was a small town, and two girls falling in love wasn't something people would look kindly on.

That's when we started going to the woods.

The woods were small--just a few dozen trees, clustered together behind our little town. You could walk into them and be out the other side in less than half an hour. For some reason though, nobody ever went in.

There was no rule about it--nobody has ever told me not to play in the woods; and yet, nobody I knew had ever gone there. When I asked them why, they kind of just shrugged, telling me they simply didn't see a reason to.

Nobody was afraid of the woods, from what I could tell. But nobody ever went in either.

So it was perfect for my dates with Marissa. We had privacy, and the woods were gorgeous. We would meet next to a specific tree (we called it the knuckle tree, since the bark was kinda bent in the shape of a fist), every day after school--we would kiss, we would talk and laugh...it was our own little sanctuary.

Until Marissa disappeared, when we were 16. I had gone to the woods after school, like always...but Marissa never showed up. She didn't call, she didn't text...nothing.

So I called her--only to find her phone ringing on the forest floor, maybe 15 feet away. I knew immediately that something was wrong. I waited an hour, then two. Marissa never showed.

I scoured every inch of those woods. I swear, I looked everywhere. I knew those woods like the back of my hand by now--if she had been there I would have seen her. I know it.

She had...left her phone behind. Maybe she had just lost it and was looking for it somewhere else, I reasoned. So I went to her house, knocking on the door and saying I had found her phone. But of course, Marissa wasn't home.

The next morning, she was reported missing. I told the police we hung out in the woods every day; that her phone had been found there--so that's where they started looking.

But they didn't find her. Obviously they didn't. Like I said--if she was there, I would have found her last night.

There was a highway behind the woods, and we figured maybe she had wandered out there. So a search party went looking, driving around in search of her. Of course, they didn't find jack shit.

I was inconsolable. I still went to the woods every day, crying, hoping she would come back, that she would somehow be there. Of course, she wasn't.

After 2 weeks, the search attempts just sputtered out. Nobody said it, but I knew they figured she was long gone by now. One theory was that some crazy person had come from the highway and kidnapped her, and she was whisked away. They called the police offices of nearby towns, but that also yielded nothing. Marissa had just...vanished.

Except...there had been no sign of a struggle, anywhere. Local police had confirmed that. And her phone hadn't been found near the highway--it was lying next to the knuckle tree, where we always met up.

So then another theory surfaced: Marissa had run away. But nothing was missing from her room--if she had run, she hadn't taken anything with her. And I refused to believe that she had left without saying so much as goodbye. She wouldn't do that. She wouldn't leave her parents, her baby sister, her friends...she wouldn't disappear like that. She wouldn't leave me. Her "best friend," the whole town thought. Of course, nobody knew we were dating.

I had lost the only person in this town who understood me. The only person I had ever loved. At 16, it felt like the end of the world. And for me, it was. I couldn't do anything anymore. There didn't seem to be a point. I just hung out in the forest, by the knuckle tree, sobbing.

I knew my parents were worried about me...but strangely, they never came into the forest to get me. They always drove to the library or the school if I needed to be picked up--but they never came near the forest.

And then--one month later, exactly 4 weeks and 4 days after she vanished (yes, I was keeping count), she was back.

I remember going to the forest after a day of zoning out at school--walking up to the knuckle tree and flopping down at its base, crying softly.

I raised my head at some point, looking up--and there she was, her back to me, wearing a gorgeous blue dress.

At first I was sure I was hallucinating. I had to be. But still--I called out to her tentatively through my sobs, hoping against hope that she was really there.

"M...Marissa? Is-is that y-you?"

She spun around, wide eyed, her face a mask of terror. As soon as we locked eyes, however, relief poured into her expression and she sprinted towards me, enveloping me in a tight hug.

"Lexy, oh my god, oh my god..." she was crying. She kissed me fiercely, and I kissed her back, still not sure if I was dreaming.

"Everyone's been so worried," I told her. "Everyone thought you were dead!"

"I..." her voice trailed off, and I saw fear flicker across her face again, her eyes shining with tears.

"Look, it's okay, it's okay, let's just...let's just get you home, yeah?" I tried to sound soft and encouraging--I knew I wasn't doing a good job, but my voice definitely helped calm her down.

The next couple weeks were a blur of questioning, of the police (and the rest of the town) desperately trying to figure out what the hell had happened to her.

She was in perfect health, not a scratch on her. She had clearly been eating fine, and the dress she was wearing when I saw her wasn't one I had ever seen before.

She didn't answer anybody's questions, about anything. She said she couldn't remember--I knew she was lying. I could always tell when she was lying.

She told me she didn't want to go into the woods anymore, that we should just hang out at her house or in her room. It felt awkward, kissing her while her parents were downstairs--but hey, we were quiet and they didn't suspect a thing.

After about a week and a half, the questioning had basically stopped. Everyone in our little town had come around and asked her how she was, if she remembered anything...and everyone knew by now that she didn't remember shit. Or so she claimed, anyway.

I wasn't going to call her on it, though. I could see the fear on her face whenever someone asked where she went. I didn't want her to look at me like that, like I was asking her something she couldn't answer.

So we held each other, did homework together, kissed in the moonlight like we always had--but she was different now. She was jumpy, always looking over her shoulder. I often found her lost in thought, staring out the window with terror in her eyes--staring at the forest.

Eventually, I couldn't bear it. I knew she was suffering, struggling with something, and I had tried to give her as much time as she needed but now I felt like I had to at least try and help.

I asked one night while we were curled up together in her bed (having a "sleepover," we told our clueless parents), holding each other.

I wasn't sure how to approach the topic delicately, so I just jumped into it.

"Baby...what happened to you when you were missing? Where did you go?"

Her reaction was immediate. She tensed, her breath coming in quick, shallow gasps. She didn't answer. Instead, she began shaking. I couldn't see her too well in the dark, but I could tell she was crying.

Immediately, I regretted asking. "Hey, sorry, uh--you don't need to talk about it. I didn't mean t-"

"No," she interrupted me. I could tell from her voice that she was *definitely* crying. "It's okay. I need...I need to tell someone. But--even *you* won't believe me, Lexy."

She didn't sound pleading or desperate when she said I wouldn't believe her. She didn't say it as though she wanted reassurance--she said it like it was a fact, written in stone.

"Baby, I know you'd never lie to me. I promise, I'll believe you. Whatever you say, I'll believe you. You could tell me you were abducted by aliens or taken by a boogieman and I would believe you, I just...I just want to know. I want to help you." My voice was cracking, and I knew I was about to cry too.

"I...I never left the woods, Lexy."

I froze, confused. "What? That's...that's impossible! I looked everywhere, the police looked everywhere, I know y-"

"I told you," she interrupted, sobbing, "you wouldn't believe me."

"No, no...baby I believe you. I do. I just...I'm a little confused, is all." And it was true. What she was saying--I knew she wasn't lying. I knew she wasn't crazy. She sounded as serious as I had ever heard, and she sounded terrified.

But how? How was it possible?

"I was waiting for you that day," she continued. "Next to the knuckle tree. I saw you coming, and I was going to wave to you...but then, he...he took me."

My eyes narrowed. Someone took her? Someone had hurt her? If someone had even so much as touched Marissa, there would be hell to pay.

"Who?" I asked her. "Who took you?"

She shook her head, still sobbing. "It...he...he wasn't a person."

That caught me off guard. "He...what?" It wasn't that I didn't believe her--I did. I believed in the supernatural, more or less; but I never thought anything dangerous would happen in our tiny town. And definitely not to Marissa.

"He looked like a person," Marissa was sobbing again. "He talked like a person, but he...he wasn't. He just seemed all *wrong*. He walked like one of those puppets on strings, like he wasn't really...I...I don't know, Lexy, I know this all sounds crazy but you have to believe me!"

"I believe you," I replied evenly. And I did. "Where...where did he take you?"

"That's the thing--he didn't take me anywhere. He just grabbed me and held me next to the knuckle tree, pressing me against him--Lexy I swear to god, he didn't have a heartbeat. He didn't breathe. He was all cold. I swear, he wasn't alive." She was speaking faster now, the words rushing out of her as though a dam had burst.

"And then you showed up and I screamed but you couldn't hear me and I could hear him laughing and he just held me in place I saw you find my phone and I swear he laughed right in my ears and shook me around with his weird puppet arms and his laugh sounded like skittering cockroaches, and I kept screaming but you couldn't hear me a-" she began sobbing again, taking deep, shuddering breaths. Finally, she continued:

"I eventually kicked backwards and heard something snap, I think it was his leg; I broke out of his grip and started running, and...and then I heard you calling to me, so I turned around and...it wasn't you, Lexy, it was *him*, and he was using your voice, telling me all these horrible things that he would do to you if I didn't come back...He just stood in front of the knuckle tree, he didn't follow me...just stared at me with his milky white eyes, grinning and showing way too many teeth and talking in your voice..."

She took another deep breath before continuing her word torrent: "I wanted to run Lexy but I couldn't, my legs didn't work, and he was laughing at me, and using your voice, and then I was just pulled towards him. My legs didn't move, I swear to god, I just slid across the ground, I don't...I...I couldn't fight him. He held me there, Lexy. I thought he would kill me but no, he just held me and...he touched me, and he told me I was going to be his until I died--when the police came he just laughed, and they couldn't hear me scream...I swear to god Lexy I thought I would be this perverted fuck's plaything until he killed me."

I stared at her, too shocked to even speak.

"You came every day, Lexy, I could see you; he always made sure I could see you while he...while he touched me. He hurt me, Lexy, every day--but it never left any marks on my body. I think he just liked to watch me scream. He was always next to me, I could barely walk five feet from the knuckle tree or he would grab me and...hurt me." She was sobbing violently now, her whole body shaking. "He pulled clothes out of nowhere and forced me to dress up for him, he put me in sick costumes and made me do...disgusting things to him...Always made sure I could see you sitting there, made sure I could never reach you. Oh god Lexy, it was...I can't..." her voice trailed off as she continued sobbing, leaning into my chest. I wrapped my arms around her, hugging her close to me, trying to process what I was being told. 

"He used your voice all the time, Lexy--he knew that was what hurt me the most, he said he watched us by the tree every day...I don't know why he let me go, Lexy. I don't have a fucking clue--he just vanished. I heard your voice behind me and I thought it was him--but you...it was you. And...you could see me. You...you were there, really there. But I know he's still there at that tree, he told me it's his home; and I think...I think if he let me go, it's because he wants to take someone else."

She stopped talking--she had stopped crying too. Talking about it seemed to have taken a lot out of her, but she seemed happier now for sure. Relieved. Relieved that I believed her.

"I'll find him," I said quietly. I could hear my own voice deepen, the way it did when I was angry.

"Lexy please, you can't go there. You...he's not human. He'll take you, I...I can't let him take you." She was crying again, holding me tight.

"He hurt you," I told her simply. "He hurt you and tortured you and touched you. And for that, he has to pay, human or not."

She knew she couldn't talk me out of this, out of going back to the tree. I had always taken care of her. Always protected her. When a boy in elementary school put glue in her hair, I knocked out two of his teeth. When a guy got too handsy with her after she told him to stop at a party last year, I had pulled him off of her, then taken him out back behind the house and broken his arm; i had torn his rotator cuff in three places so he wouldn't touch anyone that way for a long, long time.

Marissa was everything to me. When a group of girls in middle school had taken her behind the bleachers and forced her to eat the gum stuck to the bottom of the seats, I had just about lost my shit. I remember finding her there, sobbing and puking with the three girls laughing at her. She saw me and her eyes widened, I remember. "Lexy, it's three against one--Lexy don't!" I was almost reconsidering, that time...but then one of the girls kicked her in the head, sending her sprawling backwards under the bleachers and then looked back at me, laughing.

I had seen red that time, I remember. I vaguely remembered my martial arts teachers telling me it's all about self defense...but hey, the best defense is a good offense, right? All three of those girls went down--and two of them were still in wheelchairs now, five years later. I admit I had lost control a little, but I still think they deserved it.

Anyway the point is--Marissa was right to be worried, because I was most definitely about to do something really stupid. But I was angry. I wouldn't listen. She knew better than to talk me out of it...and she knew I wasn't like her. I wasn't like anyone in that town. I had a secret that only Marissa knew (and my parents, I guess), and I think she hoped it would protect me. I mean--it always had so far.

So, the next day when I set out with a can of pepper spray and a switchblade, Marissa just sobbed and hugged me. "Lexy--please come back," she told me. "Don't you *dare* die on me."

I gave her a crooked smile, twirling the knife. "Well I haven't died yet, have I?" She just shook her head at me, her beautiful eyes pleading with me to be safe.

I took off running down the street, past the school, all the way to the outskirts of our little town. The woods were only about a half mile out--but that was enough distance for me to feel confident that I was alone.

With a sigh, I let my mental restraints loosen. I took a deep breath, looking up at the blue, cloudless September sky. I felt my senses sharpen, and I looked out towards the forest, a half mile away. That's where he lived, huh? The bastard who had hurt her. Who had violated the woman I loved. With murderous intent, I started running.

I felt the muscles in my legs and my back tear--felt the bones in my shins and ankles crack from the force as I hurtled forwards, only to knit themselves back together an instant later.

In less than a minute, I was at the edge of the forest, half a mile away, walking towards the knuckle tree.

I could see the knuckle tree--it looked normal. I didn't sense anything. Undeterred, I walked up to it. "I know what you did," I said to the branches. I probably looked like an idiot, talking to a tree.

No response. I told him to show himself...nothing. *Fine,* I thought. *If he won't show himself to me, then I'll rip his home apart.* I raised a leg and kicked the tree, hard enough to feel the bones in my shin shatter.

I gritted my teeth, trying not to scream in pain. In a second, my leg was back to normal, the bone fragments reassembling themselves. I looked at the tree; the trunk had a hole in it now, about the shape of my foot. I smiled grimly. 

"Show yourself, or I will level this entire forest!" It was a bluff, of course. I liked the forest. But this tree--I was willing to destroy this tree.

Bluff or not, that got his attention. I heard a cold, clicking sound behind me, like cockroaches skittering across marble. I froze, turning slowly.

Nothing. There was nobody behind me. I swore, kicking at the tree again. This time, the trunk split in two; the tree fell onto its side, leaving only a stump behind.

"Not very polite of you," I heard from behind me. I spun around--and I saw him. Marissa was right...he really did look all wrong. At first glance, he looked normal-ish. He wore a green suit, green dress pants, and shiny green dress shoes. But then it got weird. His skin was a sickly gray color, like a rotting corpse. The way he stood...it was all fucked up. He stood with his arms outstretched, but bending at the elbows--like a scarecrow. His feet, I noticed, didn't quite touch the ground.

He really did look like some kind of weird, pervy marionette. His eyes were a pale, milky white--he didn't seem to have a nose, which made his eyes the only prominent feature of his face. Except his smile. It went literally from ear to ear, revealing rows of serrated, shark-like teeth.

I didn't move--for some reason I didn't feel like it. Like I was exhausted, like the most energizing and refreshing thing for me to do would be just to stand there...

"You come to my home, you tear down my tree," he floated towards me, his sick grin widening. "Not a great first impression, is it? Now, I wonder how you could make it up to me...Lexy, isn't it?"

At the mention of my name, I snapped out of the trance. "Don't fucking call me that," I snarled as I leapt a few feet backwards. Only Marissa called me Lexy--she was the only one who was allowed to. And hearing it from this sick *thing* was disturbing in a way I cannot quite describe. 

"Oh?" He cocked his head to the side--except it kept moving until his entire head was literally upside down above his torso. With his upside-down eyes glaring sightlessly at me, he grinned again. His mouth was stretching the other way now, so that even upside down I could see it was smiling. "Isn't that your name? Your dear *Marissa* certainly called it many times." His upside-down grin widened.

"You--you touched her," I growled. "You *hurt* her." I pulled my switchblade out of my pocket and flicked it open, the blade glinting in the sunlight.

The creature laughed, his head spinning so it was right side up again. "You're going to avenge her with *that?*" his weird, marionette looking arms clutched at his sides as he continued laughing. "You're a pretty little thing, but not very bright, are you?" His voice was dripping with condescension.

I said nothing. I didn't trust myself to speak. I was terrified and quite possibly way out of my depth. He clearly knew that, since he simply continued laughing. His grin kept widening, and frankly it was becoming downright unnerving.

*Think,* I told myself. There had to be a way to hurt him.

"Come here, sweetheart," he said in his sick, gurgling voice. "Come here and show me some skin." He giggled, a high-pitched wheezing sound that made me want to puke. I could see the lust in his milky white eyes, in his predatory grin. I didn't move. His grin shrank. "I said, *come here!*" His voice had dropped--it was suddenly disturbingly deep. Demonic.

I felt a pulling sensation, as though the entire front of my body had been slathered in superglue and stuck to something; as though something was pulling me by my skin.

I still didn't move. I fought the sensation, standing as still as I could. I heard a sickening tearing sound, grimacing as I realized it was my own skin, tearing off the front of my body in disgusting, bloody slabs that flew towards the monster.

As soon as the skin had torn, though, new skin grew under it. I saw the creature's eyes widen a bit, as though it was surprised. "Neat trick," he snarled. "You're not like her, are you? I saw it when you kicked my tree, too. You're..." he licked his lips, searching for the right word, "*Exotic.*"

The word, along with way he said it, made me shiver with revulsion.

"The strong ones are *so* much more satisfying to break," he continued. He sounded giddy--almost gleeful. It was sickening. "Your pretty little Marissa struggled for *days,* you know....made it so much sweeter when I finally broke her in." His grin widened, and he giggled--a high pitched wheezing sound that made me want to vomit. And then I heard Marissa's voice, coming out of his mouth...heard her screaming, heard her sobbing, heard her begging for it to stop...

I felt my expression darken, my eyes narrowing. I was more angry now than afraid--I forced myself to remember why I was here. Marissa. He had hurt her. Violated her. Scarred her in ways that she could never heal from. I felt the blood pumping in my veins, felt all my muscles tense.

"Hurting her was the dumbest thing you've ever done," I growled. My voice had deepened now--I didn't sound like a 16-year-old girl at all anymore. I felt my mental restraints fall apart completely...I was letting myself truly let go. I saw something flicker across the creature's face. Was that...*fear*? It was gone an instant later, as the thing's grin returned. "*I will tear your essence from your vessel,*" I snarled. Before waiting for a reply, I leapt into the air.

I felt the muscles in my legs stretch and tear, felt the bones in my shins, ankles, and thighs crack.

I was eight or nine feet in the air, I figured. My switchblade was still open in my hand. I tossed it downwards with a flick of my wrist; as the thing's face tilted upwards towards me, my switchblade hit him between the eyes and buried itself up to the hilt. *Nice shot*, I complimented myself.

Before he could even let out a gurgle of surprise, I landed on top of him, slamming my heel into the hilt of my switchblade and pushing it the rest of the way through his head.

I landed on my feet. He didn't. He fell on his back, gurgling in surprise. "Your weapon..."

"Yeah," I replied coldly, picking my blade up from beside his head. It was pure iron, and I had coated it in salt this morning. I wiped some of the blood off on the grass--it didn't really help. Much to my annoyance, he rose back to his feet, a large hole in his forehead oozing greenish-black blood.

Fucking demons, am I right?

"Clever, clever girl," hissed the green-clad demon. "Pretty *and* smart, hmm? Do you know who I am?" He giggled again.

"No," I responded evenly. "And I don't give a shit. You hurt the woman I love, in the most twisted ways. No matter who you are--I will watch you burn. You could be the devil himself, and I would still walk into the bowels of hell to see you engulfed in holy fire."

"Big words, girl--big words indeed. But I think you're just as unholy as I am, aren't you? It's why you didn't bring any holy water with you, why you're not wearing any crosses. Isn't it? Because you're a naughty, nasty little girl, aren't you? You're just a-"

"I'm human," I cut him off. "Well...more or less," I added sheepishly.

"I think less," was his reply. Then he lunged at me, and I felt that pulling sensation again, tugging me towards his disgusting body. I sidestepped, feeling some of my skin peel off as I did so.

In an instant, I was behind him. I plunged my hand into his back, feeling for a heart. I tried to ignore the feeling of my fingers splintering and my wrist breaking from the force of the strike--but goddamn, it fucking hurt. To hit someone hard enough to drive your fist *into* their body requires quite a lot of force--honestly I hadn't been sure I could do it. If I was still holding back, I probably couldn't have.

It seemed Marissa was right; he had no heart. I felt his blood sizzle where it touched me, burning straight through the skin, muscle, and bone. He giggled, his head spinning 180 degrees to face me. "You're a bad, *bad* girl, aren't you?" His grin widened. "Inside of me without even buying me dinner first, how *scandalous*!"

He began laughing again, that weird clicking sound like roaches crawling.

I was past giving a shit what he was saying or doing by now--I was angry. I was so, *so* angry.

I headbutted him, hard. I felt my skull crack a little--felt the blood from his forehead drip into my eyes, sizzling right through them and blinding me for a second until they reformed.

I kicked him, sending him sprawling backwards, yanking my hand out of his torso. My arm was just a bloody stump because of his acidic blood--but my hand reformed in a matter of seconds.

"You can't kill me," I growled, advancing towards him as he rose to his feet again.

"It seems you can't kill me either, girl--now come at me again, honey, don't be a tease!"

I glared at him. I didn't want it to come to this, but I realized now that there was no way to kill him without it.

Marissa didn't want me to have it. She was begging me not to take it, telling me that if it came down to this then I was better off leaving it alone.

No--I wasn't leaving it alone. No way in hell was I leaving this alone. I was doing this. I was ending this demon.

I pulled the pepper spray out of my pocket in an instant--the thing just laughed. "You're going to use fucking *pepper spray*? Oh sweetie, you really *are* as dumb as you look, you dumb c-"

I pulled the spray trigger. A fine, watery mist shot out of the little cylinder, and the green demon screamed. I watched as its skin seemed to melt off of its rotting, blackened skeleton, feeling a grim satisfaction at hearing its gurgled cries.

"Fuck around and find out, asshole," I spat.

And then I was running, running as fast as I could--but I had been too close to it. I felt a horrible, burning sensation in my gut, and I knew I hadn't been careful enough. *Fuck,* I thought. Marissa would never forgive me if I died like this.

In five minutes flat, I was on her doorstep, hammering furiously at the door. Thankfully, Marissa opened the door--I don't think her parents would appreciate me in this state.

Marissa took one look at me before ushering me upstairs. "You used it, didn't you." It wasn't a question.

I nodded, unable to speak. The burning was spreading to my throat now--my body couldn't heal from this.

"God dammit, Lexy...god fucking dammit."

*Excellent choice of words,* I thought.

"Did you literally just stand there and spray him with it? Jesus fucking Christ."

*Very poor choice of words,* I thought.

I felt my senses dulling, felt my muscles relaxing. I felt--calm, almost. My mental restraints were refastening. Marissa always had that effect on me. Sometimes, I almost thought that she was the only reason I was in control at all.

Marissa came back with glass, filled to the brim with a dark crimson liquid. I looked at her questioningly, and she nodded impatiently. "It's blood, Lexy. Take it."

I shook my head furiously. *I won't do it,* I told myself stubbornly. *I might die, but I'm not a drinker. Not like them.*

"Baby, *please!*" Marissa was holding the glass up to my lips. I moved my head away. My vision was starting to feel fuzzy from the burning pain, which had spread to my arms and legs...all that was left now was the head. After that--I wouldn't be able to heal at all. I would fall apart, quite literally, in Marissa's arms.

Suddenly, I realized that she was holding the glass above my mouth, literally pouring the blood down my throat. Her face was fierce. Determined. I knew better than to argue with her in this state--not that I had the strength to, anyway.

The burning lessened slightly, and I found I was able to speak again, if only barely.

"People," I rasped, "don't drink blood. I....I don't drink blood. I...I'm not... a monster. Don't--please don't make me one." Just saying that was exhausting...I could barely breathe, as though I had run a marathon.

Distantly, I found myself trying to remember whose idea it had been originally, to fill a can of pepper spray with holy water. It couldn't have been Marissa's...she knew what happened to me when I was around anything holy. I could remember her asking, "What if the can isn't enough? You're still right near the water, it could *kill* you!" Hah, well...the can *had* been enough. The issue was the spraying part, it seemed. Ah well. Nobody gets it all right on the first try, huh?

"Shut up, Lexy." Her voice was exasperated. And beautiful--so, so beautiful. "You're not a monster, you never were. And I love you, I swear I do. You have nothing to prove to me, okay? Lexy, *you don't have to prove anything to me!* I'm not making you a monster. I'm saving your life. I don't care if you hate me for it--I *have* to do this." Her voice was begging, pleading for me to understand.

I let out a soft chuckle, smiling crookedly. "I could never hate you, Mari," was all I said, before my world went black.[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/m4o6mo/i_went_to_a_catholic_boarding_school_the/)

We made preparations for the next night.

Two interesting things that we noticed – and that supported our theory – was that the hallucination always showed the same students and nuns as monsters, and that neither of the non-human students slept in our dorm.

So it obviously meant that, if they were *actually* monsters, there was a whole other dorm for them. If we carefully followed one, we’d find out.

We took the pills on an empty stomach, then headed for the refectory, trying to stay away from the insanely scary sight of the blind nun. 

“Do you know who she is?”, I asked. Both Martina and Leo had enrolled around the same time as me, but a few days earlier.

“All I know is that she only teaches the eight-graders. I never met anyone older so I have no intel on her.”

Our school only covered fourth to eight grade, with around 40 students/residents per year. Considering that, the countryside building was disproportionally big. 

One of the monsters joined the three of us for dinner; it was Lizzie, one of the smartest girls in our class. Her normal appearance was of a freckled girl with glasses and pigtails but, as a monster, she was a humanoid fox with three tails and wearing a mask over her face.

“How’s your dorm like?”, Martina boldly asked. The two of us were still recovering from the shock, and I even said a quick silent prayer to thank God for sending one of the most normal-looking monsters. I couldn’t stand to talk to one of the other things that were roaming around the dining room or sitting on the other tables.

Lizzie gasped almost imperceptibly, and then recited seemingly rehearsed lines.

“It’s normal, I think? But our overseer is Sister Agostina and she’s pretty strict so we have to be in bed perfectly punctually.”

That was something I always noticed, but never questioned. It seemed like a trivial fact in the back of my mind until Martina pointed that out.

Ten minutes before the curfew, Lizzie got up.

“Thanks for keeping me company today. I should get going. I want to brush my teeth before there’s a huge line.”

Her voice seemed forcefully cheerful.

“Good night, Lizzie.”

Martina bit her lip. “She’s pretty nice. I really want us to be wrong and give a good laugh about it later.”

“Yeah, me too. Did you manage to create the distraction?”

“Don’t take me lightly, Mr. Leonidas.”

The after-dinner curfew was 10 PM and, while the kids from our dorm stalled a little, the others were almost militarily disciplined, and one minute before that time, you couldn’t see any of them around.

There was no turning back now.

Precisely three minutes before ten, Ariana, Martina’s roommate, started screaming desperately as she profusely shat her pants in the middle of the dining room. Chaos ensued, as kids ran around screaming – some of them covered in splashes of liquid poop –, and all the nuns present had to intervene.

Ariana was a bully and constantly stole nice snacks the other kids got from their families, so I didn’t feel that bad. All Martina did was leaving a giant bag of sugar-free gummy bears lying around, it’s not like Ariana didn’t have a choice…

As the turmoil unfolded, the three of us were able to sneak to the corridor that led to the other dormitory.

At first, it was as normal as ours – richly furnished and full of paintings of former abbesses and popes. But it ended in a large, dark and cold room that was nothing like our accommodations.

After our eyes adjusted to the dark, the three of us covered our mouths in a nearly fruitless effort to not scream.

Instead of nice rooms full of sunlight and comfy beds, the other dorm was nothing but a torture chamber.

Lizzie, the kitsune, had her body completely chained mid-air, forming an X with her arms and legs. A lot of the other creatures were like that, or inside sarcophaguses that were slightly too small for their size; and that were the nice lodgings.

“Let’s see who was bad today”, Sister Maria, a Math teacher with pupils of fire, her eyes moving across the room as the cornered and helpless beasts whimpered. She then pointed to a misshapen figure of a hunchback boy with an evil-looking spare skeleton attached to his back.

Back then I had no idea what that was, but now I know it’s called a dybbuk, a being from the Jewish lore that supposedly consisted of a normal body possessed by the spirit of an evil deceased person with unfinished business. In reality, they are actually the same body and mind, with the uncanny ability to walk both among the living and the dead.

A perversion of the nature that the Church could never leave alone.

Sister Maria, a tall and strong woman who was probably in her early 40s, grabbed him by the skeletal ribcage and threw him inside an iron maiden.

“What do you have to say, monster?”

“I… I promise to be good from now on. I promise to serve God.”

“Good. Now atone.”

I’ll never forget how the screams of the poor dybbuk pierced my ears, my mind, my very soul.

Leo was trembling; we were precariously hiding behind a row of sarcophaguses and we didn’t have the luxury of talking or moving; who knew what these twisted people would do to us if they knew that their secret was out?

Sister Maria then proceeded to put others inside iron maidens and Spanish boots; the lucky ones slept on the bare floor, cold and constantly stained with the blood of the tortured ones.

What shocked me the most was realizing that, other than monsters, they were kids. They were from other species, but they were small and relatively fragile individuals. None of them was much taller than us. Especially when you looked at the vampires and other nearly-human beings – they were the equivalent of a 10-years-old, just like us.

“Sister Agostina, start the chanting.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

The two of them then proceeded to chant in Latin for no less than an hour. Martina was visibly antsy, being the first of us to realize that Sister Cecilia, the overseer of our dorm, was going to notice we were missing.

We had no choice but to watch the macabre ritual, sprinkled by the screams of the damned, motionless and silent as a lion waiting for its prey – except that we were the ones that could be preyed on.

After they finally finished, Sister Maria loosened a few pieces of the devices to attenuate the torture, as she declared that God forgave them. And then she left the room, leaving her colleague alone with their (there’s no other word) prisoners. 

“The three of you behind the coffins. My office, now.”

 

[PPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/) | [TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)I’ve been stuck in this cabin for a little over a week now. I came here to get away from the city, from the dullness and the monotony of my daily job, hoping I could write my first novel here.

This was my dream ever since I was a kid. Unfortunately, my family wanted me to be a normal person with a normal job. There never was any room for dreams in my life. I just had to go to college and study business, and then get a boring 9 to 5 job at my dad’s company.

This cabin was bought by my parents for their summer vacations before I was born. They’d acquired it for the beautiful lake that’s placed behind it. To go there you had to trek through the woods. I always thought that the trees arching above you were meant to be nature’s guardians, keeping the wildlife and all things beautiful protected under a shield of green. When I was a kid, my dad used to take me fishing there. I liked it a lot.

Right until I got reeled in under the water, the fish pulled so hard that I fell overboard.

I didn’t know how to swim, but luckily my dad jumped in and pulled me back to the surface, otherwise I’d have drowned and died. Even to this day, I never learned how to swim because from that day on the fear of going into deep waters just stuck with me.

Another unsettling thing I realized I loathed from that day on was the fact that we always stopped in the middle of the lake for fishing. We were surrounded by what seemed like a huge eye of water that made me think about monsters and horror living at the bottom. I remember always thinking what if there was another world there, another civilization that was able to live and breathe underwater.

There’s another thing that happened that day though. As I was going under I felt something touch my feet. I don’t know if it was pushing me up to my dad so he could get me out of the murky waters, or dragging me down to the depths of a liquid hellish nightmare.

Adding to the terror that was already building up, I lost my calm and as I felt water entering my mouth, flooding my lungs and silencing my screams, I began to panic. Before dad pulled me up, I turned around to see if it was just my imagination and then I completely forgot about it for the rest of my life.

Until I came back here.

Since I started writing, I always liked to do it in utter and complete silence and this cabin had that to it. It provided me the comfort I needed to get inside my own mind and to pull out the characters and the settings, the monsters, the villains and the heroes of my stories. Maybe to write about my own experiences too.

They say that the best stories come from the writer’s personal fears, so that was exactly what I wanted to write about.

It’s somewhat unique to see a setting change so fast from day to night. The chirping of birds made the outside feel so alive during the day, and the colors of nature complemented that so very well.

When the night came though, it felt like all just suddenly died down, or maybe it all went into hiding, giving way or, rather, allowing for something else to come alive. All the colors faded away, swallowed whole by the darkness of the night, lost for hours in the solemn silence.

Then everything came back to life the next morning.

The first couple of nights were just that. Silence. Nothing more and nothing less. I got ten pages done and I was very proud of myself. I thought it was the best decision I had made in regards to writing the new book.

Then, things started getting strange. In the stillness of the night, I began hearing sloshing footsteps circling my house. Whenever I peeked outside the window, there was nothing there. I was only hearing the rustling of leaves that seemed to cry out for help only for their screams to never exit from that side of the woods.

A coyote was howling somewhere in the distance, as if it wanted to let me know of some newly formed danger that was there with me, taking its time on how it would’ve been best to attack me.

I heart the mud moving again. Staccato footsteps thumping like a soggy drumline. It was an ocean sound, the kind of music that crawls out from deep, lost places. The song you’d hear before drowning.

Still nothing outside. Only blackness.

I heard a knock on the front door. Then another. And another. Someone was trying to break inside my house. The knocking turned into violent bangings.

Then it suddenly stopped. Silence again throughout the night; it didn’t last long though. A pained shriek of agony pierced through the dark veil of the night and I felt my house moving from the shock. With it, I too trembled in unspeakable horror.

The trees started shaking and the ground trembled again. This was making me mad. This was driving me insane as I felt a lost, ancient curse finally found a new host to torment.

I looked outside again. Then I saw something. Lengthy arms finishing in dark chromium-like claws were extending from beyond the tree line. They were rapidly advancing towards the cabin. Tens if not possibly hundreds of them clawing their way in through the mud. I was a sitting duck.

When they reached the house, I asked myself what was at the other end? What could the creatures that these clawed arms belonged to looked like? They started intertwining, slithering and snaking their way over the roof and finally breaking the windows.

I froze like a statue. Kept in place by my fear and rendered unable to move. I heard a thump outside and then the woods vibrated with a loud metallic hum that reverberated throughout the whole area.

The arms retracted instantly from the cabin. They dragged the claws onto the floor, splinters and woods jumping in every direction. The sound was unbearable, almost like someone screamed into my ears.

Then a drumming sound filled the air, followed by another loud metallic hum. I heard a large quantity of water splashing in the woods nearby. I instantly thought of a flood made by a gigantic rock dropped by a dark god from the furthest point of the cosmos.

The earth started shaking and the leaves were rustling. Gigantic footsteps were cracking down on the trees, laying them flat on the ground. I heard shrieks and screams of anguish and agony. It seemed like the night was hurt and bleeding. Almost dying.

Something, some other creature was attacking the monstrosities that were just in my house.

The wailing suddenly stopped for a few seconds, then a roar filled the night again. The front door was violently smashed opened and another arm was heading towards me. At an impossible speed, it wrapped itself around me. Like a snake suffocating its prey, it squeezed me so hard that I lost conscience.

I woke up to the sound of my body being dragged through the mud. Things were slithering next to me and I knew what they were.

They were taking me to the lake. To drown me. To eat me.

Their claws slowly begin tearing my skin and parting the flesh on my arms. I felt the sharp pain coursing through my body, as warm blood was getting lost in the mud. I managed to raise my head up from the ground and parallel to me there was the shape of a creature. Following alongside, its red eyes never seemed to lose sight of me.

It was probably their leader. The thing that have would me for dinner in the kingdom below the lake. It would eat my flesh, drink my blood and spit out the bones.

I watched in horror both at the lake and at the creature trekking through the trees. At that very moment, it occurred to me how lucky I was of escaping death by drowning when I was just a child. I knew for sure that the things tried to pull me to the depths right then.

Now I wasn’t so sure I would make it out alive. In fact, I was one hundred percent sure my death would be slow and agonizingly painful. Another claw hit me in the face and momentarily blinked me. The red-eyed monster disappeared from sight and I felt my body entering the cold waters of the lake.

This was it. My demise. My end.

I tried to break free but to no avail. The arms were wrapped around me, their pointy claws pushing against my skin. I was under the waters, the light coming from the moon being the only thing that shone through this place where all sound dies.

On the brink of unconsciousness, I felt things getting stuck and sucking on my skin. I tried to move but the arms were still wrapped around me.

I felt the last breath of air escaping my lungs and getting lost in this infinite watery darkness in the form of bubbles.

Right before dying, right before I got a chance to see if there was a light at the end of the tunnel, the arms let me go. I felt them going back to the depths, scared.

Something pulled me up again from the water and onto the shore. It started resuscitating me. I began coughing, water jumping out from my lungs and splashing my face. My dad saved me again; except he was different this time. He had red eyes and he was just a shadow made of water. I tried speaking to him but found out I couldn’t do it.

“I’m not your dad, I’m just a monster. I saved you then and I saved you now, child. You are safe now, those things can’t hurt you ever again,” the creature said.

I froze in fear upon realizing that it was the same creature that followed me when the arms dragged me underneath the murky waters. He was in pain, his breathing hissed, and black blood the texture of mud dripped from his mouth and onto the ground below.

He told me he wouldn’t hurt me but he too needed help. His name was just that, Monster. He’s been there in the lake since forever. Since before the world even existed. He was protecting the woods and the lake itself from those things that attacked me.

The Monster told me he doesn’t know what they are. Or when they first appeared. Whenever they feel fresh blood near the lake they want to want to kill. They need to feed.

The creatures were always strongest during the night time, he also added. That’s why I probably escaped that day. With a little help from him too. For that, I’ll be grateful for the rest of my life.

He said he needed to rest somewhere where warm water exists. His wounds would’ve healed quickly; he was immortal after all. I suggested the bathtub back at my cabin and he agreed.

I turned the water on and I saw kindness and solitude burning in his red eyes. He looked at me like he owned me one, when in fact he was the one who saved my life twice.

“Thank you so very much, child. You are a kind soul. I am forever in your debt…” he said while letting out a grunt of satisfaction upon placing himself in the tub.

“No, Monster. You saved my life twice. I am indebted to you for all eternity and beyond,” I replied.

I turned around to leave and before doing so he asked me to come close to him. He gave me an emerald talisman, a powerful ancient artifact that would keep me safe from the things that lurk below the murky waters.

“You will be a fine writer; I can already see it. Please, can you write about me? I feel like no one knows me. Except you, of course…” he said, a sigh of hurt escaping his mouth.

I nodded and closed the door. I slept like a baby that night. It was like nothing ever happened. Maybe the amulet that Monster gave me helped me heal faster.

The next morning, I went up to the bathroom to see if he was still there. He was not. The water was filled with moss and algae that danced slowly in what looked like a miniature lake trapped inside a bathtub.

I sighed and thanked him once again, wherever he was in that lake.

Now people will know about you.

[Thousands of people will know about you, Monster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/comments/gpnh5h/story_masterpost/)

[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/jvvtav/author_database/)It all started about three weeks ago... That's when I first heard about this piece. This forgotten (or deliberately hidden) symphony that would go on to absorb the rest of my month. Morning Mist.

As part of our Masters course in musicology, we have to produce a thesis. Me and two fellow students decided to investigate the link between mental health and musical composers. That old romantic tale of the tortured genius, suffering for their art. I'm sure your familiar with the cliche.

We were gathered together in the University library, which had served as our base of operations this year. I won't name the specific institution, but it is known for it's vast and ornate library. With high ceilings, a labyrinth of corridors and bookshelves, and row upon row of oak wood tables. All dimly lit with a soporific yellow hue. 

We sat at one of these tables, amongst a pile of books and our lap tops. 

It was Pippa who first broke the studious silence with an audible 'wow' as she read an article on her computer. Sam looked up, and I raised a quizzical eyebrow. For the record, Pippa is a lovely girl, and a good friend. She's also extremely clever. Which is why I find her penchant for the paranormal so baffling. She religiously checks her horoscope every week, and is regularly updating us on the latest ghostly goings on (according the the myriad of questionable podcasts she subscribes to). 

So when she exclaims 'wow', I tend to take this with a pinch of salt. I was ready to ignore it and continue reading, but Sam took the bait and asked her "what'cha reading Pip?"

She looked up. "Have you ever heard of a composer called Vassily Petrov?" 

Neither of us had.

"Apparently he was a composer in Soviet Russia. He generally wrote pretty middle of the road music, for the politburo events. Nothing spectacular, probably why we've never heard of him. Then in the late 40s he was arrested by the secret police and sent to a gulag for 5 years."

"Nothing too 'wow' inspiring so far" I said skeptically. 

"But listen to this" she went on. "When he was released people say he had been driven mad by the experience. He was still composing. But crazy atonal symphonies that would make Stravinsky blush. Stuff no orchestra wanted to play. He eventually hung himself in 1956. Just after finishing his final piece, called 'Morning Mist'. But check this out... This is his suicide note, how creepy is this:

I have seen terrible things. Things no human should see. And everytime I close my eyes these visions are burned into my retinas. Music has been my only solace these last few years. But I know my pieces are deranged, and will never be performed. If there is anyone left to cry for me, I beg them not to. I feel like i am already dead, I died a long time ago, in that terrible place. And I have only been a ghost of my former self since. 

"And here's the crazy part..." Pippa quickly added. "There's a postscript... It reads:

PS. On my desk is a manuscript where I have penned my final piece. Please destroy it. It should never be played or performed. It has a melody in that are not for mortal ears. I can't explain it, I feel like some dark energy channelled through me, and forced my hand to compose. I've tried to hide it in the music. But I still hear it over and over in my mind. It is this violin line that has driven me to take my own life"


"Oooh... Spooky" Sam said with a smile. "I mean, this guys definitely nuts. Add him to the list! Vassily Petrov".

"There's more..." Pip said. "This article said the only surviving copy of the manuscript is..." She did a drum roll with her fingers on the table "right here in this library!"

"I guess people didn't take his advice and destroy it," I said. "Okay... Creepy pasta stuff aside. I think it's a good case study to see the kind of music someone composes with post traumatic stress. I'm in. Sam and I will look for it, you keep researching online". 

*************

Our search lasted all night. With no results. It wasn't under V for Vassily, or P for Petrov. Or indeed M for Morning Mist. But... According to the online records there was a copy in the library somewhere. So we continued the search, all week. It was just to intriguing to let go off.

It wasn't until the Friday when I was sweeping over a section of the library I'd already covered. In a secluded corner, deep in the maze of corridors. I don't know what made me do it, but I started pulling books of the shelf and checking behind them. There was a gap where manuscripts could easily fall.... I reached into the darkness and felt around for...

"Got it!" I said as I walked back to the table smiling and waving the papers in my hand. I was treated to a miniature round of applause from my study parties as we excitedly laid it out on the table.

"Jesus" Pip said as we began reading through. All the pages were yellowed with time, and it had a damp, rotten smell eminating from it. But it was the way it was written that elicited our mutual shock. I'd never seen a score like this.

It was written frantically, with strange markings and unrecognisable directions on. Strange unintelligible notes were scribbled in the margins. 

"Shall we start analyzing?" I asked the team.

"Before we do... And I know what you're going to say.." Pippa said.

Here it comes I thought...

"I've been reading up online. And they say the piece is cursed." I rolled my eyes, but she continued. "Seriously look."

She pulled up some tabs on her browser. They were news articles relating to the mysterious music. 

Petrovs close friend, who inherited his compositions after his death was the first. He had the manuscript to Morning Mist. He died under mysterious circumstances a few days later. Reports were he poisoned himself. According to the article he had the manuscript laid out on his table in the room when he died. 

The next was a amatuer orchestra in Russia in the 70s. They tried to perform the piece. But in first rehearsal, the lead violinists went berserk half way through. Started stabbing people with his bow. Almost killed one of them

The last was was in the 90s. It had made its way to a library in America. Some musical prodigy kid checked it out. Two weeks later it says he shot up his school and then turned the gun on himself. Once again, in his bedroom he had clearly been studying this piece of music.

"Pshh... Bollucks. What even are these websites. Ghosthunters.org... paranormal times. Im sure Rachmaninoffs Isle of the Dead is far scarier that this piece".

Pippa looked uneasy. As to be honest did Sam. But we went ahead anyway. 

We decided the best thing to do would be to try and recreate the score on the computer.  For anyone who doesn't know, you can create each part, line by line using software. this was no easy feat though. The piece was incredibly complex. And all the strange markings took weeks to decipher. 

There was also this strange feeling we had as we worked on it. You know that feeling when you're being watched. That makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

At Pippa's request we never listened to the whole piece as we worked. Only short snippets.

I have to admit. Even these snippets were disconcerting. They were cacophanic and disorientating. I had listened to a full 20 seconds and I had to admit I felt a little sick afterwards. And we still hadn't even added the lead violin line.

Sam had an alternative theory to Pippa's 'cursed violin melody' hypothesis. He had been reading that much like subliminal advertising. Where old TV ads would flash imperceptible images on screen to try and make viewers subliminally want to buy a product. Music could work the same way. Different frequencies superimposed together could have a disorientating effect.

Still a stretch to see how this could make someone harm themselves or another. But we proceeded with caution none the less. We even split up the violin line. So I did the first section. Sam the second. Pippa the last. So none of us heard the whole thing.

After a few sleepless nights, we finished transcribing it onto the computer software a few days ago. But still none of us have listened to it in its entirety.

Which leads me to today. We've hired the big studio on campus to finish our work and have a listening party. As is customary on a big project.

But this has proved quite contentious. As I write this, we have it loaded up on our computer and ready to play through the high end speaker system. I'm keen to click play. It's no doubt creepy, but there's no such thing as a 'cursed piece' and I don't buy Sam's theory of subliminal messaging. 

Pippa has said she will leave the room, but is imploring us not to listen either. 

Sam is on the fence and has the deciding vote. But he needs convincing. 

Do you guys think we should press play?Back in October of last year, I applied for a job as a hotel bellboy, and the interview came with some peculiar rules. I’d been laid off in August, like many others, due to the pandemic. This opening came up in passing during a conversation at a bar.

I was camping on a college friend’s couch at twenty-two, and we’d decided to meet his girlfriend to get out of the house and have a drink with her old sorority sisters. The term outdoor and fifty percent capacity had been stretched to its limit in Hoboken. The only real change since the pandemic was that no one could sit at the bar and put less tables on the floor, meaning seating was cramped.

That’s how I met Katherine. In the commotion, my group had rushed to find seats with some friends we already knew. Katherine had been talking to my friend Jill when everyone scrambled to make room for us, and she hesitated to move during the seating shuffle. When everyone was settled, my roommate had stolen Jill away to another table, and Katherine was trapped with us. Kathrine, a pretty blond girl with big brown eyes and definitely one of Jill’s sorority sisters.

While conversation kicked up for our group, Kathrine was quiet, obviously feeling kind of awkward and excluded. I guessed she only really knew Jill, so I struck up a conversation with her to be polite. Of course, there’s a limited number of topics near strangers are comfortable having with each other at first. Inevitably, I asked her what she did for a living.

“I work at The Magnum,” she said as if I’d know what that was.

To be fair, most of my friends who’d taken up business degrees and gotten jobs as analysts of some kind answered the question that same way. My biology major didn’t lend itself to company names. When I asked, she explained it was a luxury hotel in the city.

“I thought hotels weren’t doing so well right now,” I said.

“It’s the type of place with clients rich enough to rent out floors for six weeks,” Kathrine explained. “We kind of don’t worry about rotating traffic. Pays well. Tips are pretty good too. Biggest problem is the short staff since...you know.”

The giant unemployment elephant in the room all us young workers refused to acknowledge hovered wordlessly between us. I spent the rest of the night talking to her about hockey, latching onto the fact that she was a Devil’s fan, at least.

I didn’t really get desperate enough to consider hotel service until a month later when my already pathetic savings had dwindled to almost nothing and none of my other prospects had panned out in my field. I was staring down my last can of tuna and, though Brian hadn’t asked, I knew I should be paying rent or moving out by now. I wasn’t going to move in with my asshole dad and my mom just sold her house to pay for her own hospital expenses. Money, any money, would do. I decided to take a chance and text Katherine, hoping she wouldn’t be offended that this was the first time I was reaching out to her since we met.

I got an automatic message back that I was texting a landline.

I half assumed then that she gave me a fake number, one off from her cell or something. Part of me found that amusing. I called it, half-expecting an automatic machine to tell me it’d connect me to the moon in the rejection system. This would be a funny little anecdote to tell Jill if that was the case, and, maybe, a little concerning for my social skills. But, no. Two rings in, Kathrine picked up.

“Hello?”

“Oh! Hi,” I said, stilted, shocked she was actually on the other side. “Kathrine? This is Katherine right?” Right about then I realized I didn’t remember her last name. “Um...from the bar the other night for Jill Delaney’s sorority sister reunion. It’s Jesse by the way.” Smooth as sandpaper.

“Yes, I remember. You alright, over there, Jesse?”

“Yeah, I just didn’t expect you to answer a landline.”

“Right,” she said sheepishly. “I forgot that. They don’t really let us use cellphones here, so I kind of fell into the habit of giving out people my work phone. Sorry. You can call me Kat, by the way.”

“Kat, ok. You’re working. I can call back, or you can call me back, or--” I heard myself making a bigger deal out of a simple question than it should be. “I had a question about your job...if you were still hiring--I mean the Magnum. Like, if it was still…hiring.”

I was listening to myself nervously rattle off nonsense wondering why I wasn’t dropping dead from mortification yet. Somehow, after that mess, Katherine didn’t immediately hang up. She even told me she’d ask the manager about potential openings.

I didn’t hear back anything for two days and had almost forgotten about it when my friend Brian dropped a manila envelope on my lap. It was addressed to me, though I usually had my mail forwarded to my mom’s in South Jersey. But, there it was, and when I opened it, there was a little introductory letter to me in type and textured paper.

The Magnum

I looked at the rules and flipped to the other pages in this packet to see a map of the parking and first floor, contact information, clothing requirements, and an old-fashioned brochure listing benefits, responsibilities, and average salary of a bellboy--all of which were far too good for what I expected to be a minimum wage experience.

“I think I’m being pranked,” I told Brian, letting him read over the rules. Brian laughed and told me to toss it in the garbage or just frame it.

It was garbage, yeah, but I knew the only person who would have tailor-made this garbage for me. I was flattered, really. This was pretty elaborate, and I’ll admit very detailed, down to the weathered look of the floor map. I went to text Kat then remembered I still had to ask for her cell. I called the landline to say thanks for the prank gift.

“I didn’t send you anything,” Kat said, sounding genuinely surprised.

“I thought it was funny, Kat. The rules list is kind of just dramatic, don’t you think?”

“Rules?” Kat sounded confused over the phone and then laughed. “Oh, right! I forgot how weird they are when you start this job.”

“What?”

“I didn’t send you anything,” Kat said again. “All I did was mention you to my manager. Lied a bit and said you had some experience in hospitality--it’s not like this job is demanding. He asked for your name and address and I know you live with Jill’s boyfriend so...easy enough. Your name is Jesse Faulks right?”

“Yeah.”

“He sent you a package, right? Lots of weird rules?”

“If it is only you and the interviewer, you will introduce yourself first with the following phrase: ‘What a swell day it is to be out yonder,’” I read dramatically

“Yep,” Kat said, laughing a little. “You are actually supposed to follow them.”

“Seriously? I’m not going to remember all this trash,” I said. “Not without a checklist or something.”

“Hold on.”

Kat hung up and she didn’t call back in a few minutes. She didn’t call back until the next day.

“Hey, Jesse!” Kat said. “So, I asked around and I was right. You don’t have to worry, it’s always the same. The rules are overcomplicated. If you want I can go over them with you, but, essentially, you’re supposed to follow the 2b. rule set.”

“That’s it?”

“Yeah.”

I felt the biggest weigh lift off my chest then, thinking of having an income again. If these people wanted me to sing and tap dance, I’d learn the choreography, fine. At the end of the day, I’d have the job and it’s easier to hire someone than fire them. If this was all just a complicated hazing, fine. I asked Kat exactly what lines I had to know for my playact of an interview. She started listing them off casually, but then sort of petered off.

“If you don’t think you’ll have it by Saturday,” Kat said, a little hesitantly, “I can come over and help you go over it.”

I grimaced. She was inviting herself over. Kat seemed sweet and I wanted to think of it as a kind gesture, but this felt a little too above and beyond. I held the phone to my chest, panicking, looking for Brian to hiss my concerns at, but he was off at the gym. *Suggest somewhere public*, I thought to myself.

“Uh...how about we talk it over at, like, the park instead? Tomorrow? When do you get off work?”

“I’m off at six, tomorrow, actually.”

It’d be dark by then. “There’s a coffee house nearby. We could meet at the green.”

She agreed and I hung up feeling pretty good about relocating it to somewhere impersonal. Brian laughed at me and I realized I probably made it sound more like a date. Shit.

The not-date review of the rules was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. Kat seemed truly eager to get down to business reviewing what to do and when. She kept the list in her hand and made me recite each step. We ignored all the caveats and kept to the bare necessities of the path she and the other employees went through.

“And after you leave your stuff in the bin--”

“--but the jacket I can take,” I chime in.

“When you get inside the room and sit in the back chair, you’ll say…”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, I am excited for this opportunity to become a part of the Grand’s illustrious-bullshit-team.”

Katherine smiled wide, observing me with wide brown eyes. “You’re hired,” she teased.

I felt pretty alright about Saturday. The attire required was another hurdle, but not as bad as the others. Black pants, black shirt with a collar, black shoes, red tie. I had some slacks from my graduation and borrowed the shirt from Brian. Jill and I found a tie for a buck at a thrift store.

I took the subway into the city and made it to The Magnum at sometime around 9:50. As Kat had promised, the east entrance was closed, which meant I was going around to the south entrance. The building itself looked like any other hotel I’d seen in the city, tall, stone structures with filigree and crests that added some extra air of importance to the structure’s existence. To add to that, it was right across from the park, but only four blocks from a Chipotle. Nothing in the city is above being neighbors with convenient fast food.

Before I even got inside, however, everything kind of quickly went sideways. The east-side entrance was closed as it was supposed to be, and I hardly even looked at it before walking over to the south-side. But, then the south-side door was closed. It was the south-side door. The filigree was of a woman and it was the door I was supposed to walk through. But, I pulled on the handle, knocked, and waited. No one came, and I rushed immediately back to the east-side door, half-dreading that it was the open one. If that was the case, I was screwed. I only knew the rules for the B scenarios. But, when I tried that door, it was just as locked as the other.

“The hell…” I walked around the street looking for another entrance, but couldn’t find one. It was soon 10: 05 and I was wondering if something had gone wrong. So, I did the only thing I could think of and called Kat. She answered quickly enough.

“What do you mean the door’s closed?” Kat snapped.

“It’s Saturday, isn’t it?”

“Yeah, it is. You’re supposed to be here, I saw it on Robert’s schedule. He...Hold on, I’m coming down, just go to the east side of the building and walk past the door and to the alley. There’s an employee entrance there, I can let you in. Just wait there!”

She hung up on me and I practically sprinted back around the wide building. The alley she was talking about was the odd backing to an otherwise opulent building. The walls were flat, the dumpsters crowding both sides and half-open, reeking with garbage. Even in the middle of morning, it was dark in that little crack of space.

The door Kat mentioned was a bland, gray door that looked severe and functional, completely detached from the gaudy facade that decorated the front. I paced up and down the chipped asphalt, dodging the glass chips and piles of crates. Then, the white door opened, and I turned at attention.

But, it wasn’t Kat at the door.

“What are you doing back here, kid? You lost?” a man asked. He wore a trim red and black uniform and a little name tag that said *Eddie.*

Instinctively, I would have answered “no” and babbled about being here for an interview, but I knew I wasn’t supposed to be back here. This was off the interview’s script and if this was my only entrance, I couldn’t be shooed away from it.

“I’m the new guy. J--Rob told me to come in this way today,” I said, boldly plucking the name I heard Kat use. “But I...I….” I made an awkward gesture toward the door, trying to convey going through and hoping vague complications seemed like an understandable enough thing for him to understand.

“Oh,” he said, seeming to think my uncertainty was warranted. His thin lips pressed together tight and he gave me an odd kind of look. He may have wanted to say something, but instead quickly shouldered a large garbage bag that’d been laid at his feet behind him and held the door open for me. “Go on then. He’s got an interview or something today, so you can wait for him in the break room. 15E.”

I took the door from him and held it open in turn so he could take the garbage. “Thanks.”

Eddie nodded. His bag was dripping garbage slime, which is never pleasant, but he didn’t seem bothered to have it hauled over his shoulder. When he walked it past me, there wasn’t the lingering smell of garbage, but there was something like iron. He walked on, and I walked into the hotel, the door closing behind me. I looked down at the polished floor, and there were stains when the garbage bag had been. They were a little ruddy red-brown, like the kind you’d see on a counter or a cutting board after cutting up a steak.

*Expired meat*, I thought to myself. I realized Eddie wouldn’t take long to throw out the trash and I had to be out of sight by the time he arrived to not get caught. I sprinted down the hall, through a few sets of double doors, heading *inward* to the best of my approximation, hoping to hit a lobby or room numbers to guide my way. Soon enough, the tile floor turned to green carpet, and the ornate facade was back as I walked into the main rooms.

I looked at the first door beside me. 025E. It wasn’t where I was supposed to be, but it gave me an idea of where to go. Kat showed me a direct route on the map, so I knew I had to walk to the North Wing first, which meant following E’s numbers until they dwindled to 1 near the lobby, and then continuing on the way I would have if I entered through the southern entrance. I still had my coat and my phone, but this wasn’t unmanageable. I could fake it.

First thing first, I had to get rid of my stuff. The hall was ornate, decorated with slim wooden tables and delicate golden electric lighting. There were pieces of ivory, jade and copper art that looked expensive. I quickly removed my coat and my phone by 011E and kind of bundled both up and shoved it in a nice, wide porcelain vase. I wasn’t about to lose a stupid interview over a technicality.

I continued on, half-afraid I was already lost until I hit the first wall with a copper bust of some 1800s guy. Kat had mentioned it before. I was in the hall directly behind the lobby and standing directly behind the concierge desk now. All I had to do from here is turn left--or I would have if I was coming from the south-side. Now, I just had to keep walking and I’d be there. I’d keep going, turning right at the women’s restroom, and then 002N was on the right.

As I got to the bust, two chatting women, dressed as staff, rounded the corner and spotted me. When they did, they went dead silent. They didn’t slow down, but they stared, jaws falling a little slack at the sight of me. I tried to smile back, but they ducked their heads away and kept walking. One of the girls dropped something. It was heavy enough that they should have been able to hear the dull thud, but they rounded the corner instead of stopping.

It was a key. I picked it up and it was clearly an old-fashioned room key, not a card for an electric door, but a heavy brass key with a little tag that said 001. I backtracked a little, trying to catch their attention. They’d huddled closer together, walking arm and arm, whispering and giggling to one another. One threw her head back to sneak a glance at the empty hall and looked genuinely surprised to see me. I held the key up, showing her wordlessly what she left. She nodded and tossed her head to the side as if saying, *get going.*

“But--”

She raised her hand to her lips and turned her back to me, breaking into a run arm-in-arm with her friend. I turned the key over in my hands. This was the part of the hall I was supposed to walk into. The instructions said I wasn’t supposed to talk to staff. Maybe she knew that. Maybe she was one of Kat’s friends and was helping me out. Should I have left the key on the ground? Was this a part of this weird hazing? I half debated just leaving it on the floor, but it was in my hand anyway. I’d turn it into the guy at my interview and tell him what happened. Maybe that was the point of it.

Finally, I found room 002N was where Kat said it’d be, the second to last door in a dead-end hall. The last door, 001, was propped open, slightly ajar. It was open just a crack, but the lights were off, giving me only a glimpse of the carpet. I knocked twice like I was supposed to.

“Come in!” I heard from the other side of the door.

I remained outside, at ease, knowing what Kat and I had rehearsed.

“Hey! I said come in!” the guy on the other side called a little louder.

I shifted a little, debating if I should knock again. No. Two knocks. Kat had even wrapped her knuckles against the table when we went over it. I was supposed to wait for two knocks.

As I waited, I heard another noise just behind me, from 001. The door squeaked on its hinges. When I turned, it was a little more open, but I still couldn’t see much inside from my angle. I could hear something inside, though. Someone was moving around, scratching against the wall just across from me. I heard a voice like an old man’s moan weakly.

“Help,” he said, his voice sorrowful and cracked. “Somebody. Help.”

I don’t know what made me weary. Maybe it was something in the voice, desperate and gravelly, yes, but a little too clear, like it knew I was there to hear it. Some instinctive part of me told me to stay put. Then, the groaning stopped and there was a heavy thud, like a fist pounding the wall. I heard the man inside groan and shuffle again, slowly making its way down the length of the room, closer to the door.

I knocked again at 002N. “Hey! Hey, there’s someone here!” I called only to be met with no response. The groaning crept closer to the door.

“Help! Je...Jesss….Help!”

I rushed to door 001, grabbed the handle and slammed it shut. I didn’t look inside, but I caught a waft of the *smell*. The pungent stench of a sewer on a rainy day came to mind, like something had died and rotted inside. Then, a hand reached out and grabbed my wrist and tugged. I was thrown back against the opposite side of the hall and there was Kat, pulling the door closed. Room 001 shook as the thing on the opposite side threw its full weight against the door.

Kat turned and looked at me, holding her hand out. “The key!” she hissed. “The key!”

My hands were shaking as I fished into my pocket for the brass key. I hardly had it out of my pocket when Kat snatched it away and locked the door. Another powerful bang sent her stumbling back to the opposite side of the hall.

It was then I heard two calm, controlled knocks behind me. I nearly jumped back to the *other* side before suddenly remembering this was 002N and I was waiting on them. I looked to Kat, who paused, midway through fixing her blouse. Kat pulled me onto my feet and fixed my tie.

“Don’t worry about that,” Kat whispered hastily. “Tell them you locked the door with no one’s help. I wasn’t here. Go.”

I practically threw the door open and sprinted in.

Three members of the hotel staff sat inside, all very composed, and evidently confused by my heavy breathing and my no-doubt, priceless expression.

“What’s the matter, Love? You look absolutely shaken!” the woman behind the desk asked.

“A--” I immediately shut my mouth, taking in exactly who was in the room and where.

There were three people like Kat had warned me, but they weren’t...they were more distracting than I expected. Kat told me to expect there to be a man in a red vest, and I did since I’d stumbled into his chair. What I didn’t expect was for him to be badly burned. A nasty, pinkish scar ran up his neck, shriveling his chin, his ear and his nostrils. One eye was permanently shut and the other was crooked.

The other was a woman who stood in the corner. She loomed over the chair next to the man in red, her sunken eyes fixed intesely on me. There’s no other word to describe her other than intense. I felt like I was under scrutiny for how I moved and how loud my steps were as I passed her. She was very tall, so tall she had developed a hunch from years of bending her neck to look down at people. She said nothing to me, but her head turned, tracking me as I went.

The last was the woman in green I wasn’t supposed to speak to, and she was sharply dressed and quite pretty, but was also the one sitting behind the desk where I expected my interviewer to be. I wasn’t supposed to speak to her, wasn’t I? That was the whole point Kat had drilled into my head. The one I wasn’t supposed to worry about was the looming woman who twitched when I took my seat in the chair behind the desk.

“Could I get you a glass of water, love?” the woman in green asked sweetly. “You’re our 10 o’clock, aren’t you? Jesse Faulks?”

I wasn’t allowed to speak to her, wasn’t I? Did that include nodding?

“He’s skinny,” the tall one said, buggy eyes still set on me. Her pale tongue darted out to lick her lips. “Sticks.”

“Behave, Lorie,” the man told the tall woman. “Jesse, this is Lorie Bellaford, honorary front office manager,” he said, nodding to the tall woman. He then gestured to the woman in green. “Frederika Sardie, the general manager of this hotel, and I’m Robert Strauss, chief concierge and hiring manager. You can tell us a little about yourself.”

“I...uh...I…. It’s a p-pleasure to meet you as well, I am excited for this opportunity to become a part of the Grand’s...” I couldn’t remember the stupid word used between this part.

“Illustrious team,” Frederika supplied. “Close enough, I’d say.”

The three of them chuckled a little. I looked at Robert. “I...there’s something in room one that--”

Robert held up a hand. “We’ll get to that.”

“...Kay.”

“Did you have any trouble finding the entrance?” Robert asked.

“No.”

“No?”

“I uh...Someone walked out when I walked in.”

“At which entrance?”

“The east one.”

“Why’d you lie?”

“I...I didn’t have any trouble finding the entrance.”

“Do you know what was in the bag?” Lorie asked, her voice pitched high and eager.

“What bag?” Robert asked, looking confused.

“The bag Eddie had,” Lorie said.

I shook my head, too terrified by her gaze to really reply to her.

Robert arched a brow. “You saw Eddie? The janitor.”

“For a second,” I said hesitantly.

Robert and Frederika shared a look, but Frederika smiled. “It is an *east-side* entrance.”

Robert cleared his throat and moved on. “Then you saw two girls drop a key to room one. Why’d you keep it?”

“I...I wasn’t going to keep it. I was going to give it to you when I came in, but then--”

“--Room 1,” the woman in green supplied.

I almost answered in the affirmative and then stopped myself. She smiled wide, amused to nearly catch me.

“What’d you do?” Robert asked.

“I...I closed the door and locked it.”

“That’s it?”

“Yeah.”

“Why didn’t you go into the room to see who was calling?” he asked.

“I had a bad feeling.”

“And you weren’t tempted to look? Walk in, just see?” Robert asked.

“That was a test, wasn’t it?” I asked. “Are people supposed to look?”

“If they don’t want to be here,” Lorie said with that wrinkled, over-eager grin.

“Does she upset you?” Frederika asked me suddenly with a wicked grin. As she did, Lorie’s wrinkled face curled into a frown and her eyes were still menacing facing me. I wanted to protest, but I’m not supposed to speak to her, and then I started weighing how much I cared about the rules in a place already as twisted as this. “She does, doesn’t she?” Frederika taunted. “Hear that, Lorie? He thinks you’re disgusting.”

Lorie stomped forward and suddenly was looming over me, and I had nowhere to go but the back of my chair as buggy eyes glared further and further down at me. Then, Robert cleared his throat. “That’ll be enough. Thank you.”

Lorie and Frederika stood and I stood as well as they both made their exits. I looked to Robert then. “What kind of place is this?”

“One that requires discretion, a good sense of memorization and improvisation. I think you’ll be a good fit here,” Robert said, standing and walking over to the desk. He unlocked a cabinet drawer and pulled out some papers. He then drew a handkerchief and reached up, pulling up a piece of the skin at the top of his forehead. I nearly leapt up out of my seat as he started peeling the skin back.

“Holy--”

Robert kept pulling until half his face was removed, and there was no fleshy muscle beneath, just a regular half of a face. It was makeup. Burn makeup. “Excuse me a moment. The prosthetics itch, but I’d like to make you an offer to sign on with us.”

“It was all makeup?” I snap.

“Part of the interview. The bag Eddie carried was meant to be suspicious and Joe gets a kick out of scaring the new guys in room one. See, like I said, this is a job that’s unpredictable, and we look for a certain personality type. We try to learn it as quickly as possible.” Robert wiped off the rest of the makeup with his handkerchief and looked like a normal man in his mid-forties. “Most people break with Lorie or forget the rules with Freddie.”

I looked dumbfounded from the door to him. “That’s it? That’s the interview?”

“Yes.”

“Don’t you want to ask me questions?”

“I’ve learned about everything I need to know from you. The fact that you were able to find us and send a letter of inquiry to us at all is a start to let me know you know what kind of place this is. Following the rules and your reaction to our surprises for you tells me everything else I need to know.”

“What kind of place do you work that you need me to know how I’d react to a bloody bag and a guy moaning from another room?”

Robert straightened and smiled as if that was a question with the most obvious answer. “We’re a luxury hotel. Half our job is going about as if it’s business as usual, but it’s not. There’s a lot of protocol to follow and it requires you to know what to do in a lot of situations. Did you have anyone help you with the rules?”

“No,” I say as I rehearsed. “I wasn’t supposed to show them to anyone else. Also an extreme part of this test?”

“Good,” Robert said. “If you can’t memorize and follow those instructions in the time we gave you, then you wouldn’t be able to handle this job. But you were a natural, but you still have enough independent thought that you’re not completely lacking in critical thought. You’ll do well here.”

“Listen, after all of this, I don’t even know if I want this job.”

Robert didn’t say anything, just showed me the starting salary. “This was the walk through fire. But, I can guarantee, if you sign on with us, so long as you stick to the rules, you’ll be fine.”

The first set of rules wasn’t so bad. This was all an act, and if this was some weird idea of promoting discretion, then fine. Joe and Eddie were a set up. I could keep my mouth shut. If they’d let me in and all I had to do was learn a routine, fine. So, I took the job. It was better than anything I’d get in a lab, and in that moment things had gone from terrifying to completely lax. I signed a contract there and went home with a set of rules, a schedule and a signing bonus.

I was giddy all the way home, waving my check in Brian’s face. Jill came by later and I wholeheartedly thanked her too. “Jill, I’m so glad you keep good friends,” I said as I tore into the new rules list.

“What do you mean?”

“Katherine.”

“Who?”

“Katherine….” I still couldn’t remember her last name. “Jill, your sorority sister. You were sitting with her at your reunion before we arrived.”

“Oh,” Jill nodded.

I turned back to my employee contract and pulled out the new list of rules, flipping to the first page. “You mean that blond girl?” Jill asked. “I only met her that night. I thought she was a friend of yours.”

Rule 1: Never speak to Katherine. Never give her your name.

Well..shit.
