I absolutely love horror. Growing up I was always the odd kid out, wanting to watch another cheesy B movie. To me it was exciting to get that rush of adrenaline pumping in your blood and no matter how many times I watched some of these I would still jump when the monster popped out or something unexpected happened. 

I got a little obsessed in my teens. Dressing up as some of the more iconic movie monsters for Halloween, getting involved in some of the extreme haunted houses. Any friend I did have was long gone when they realized I was into the really weird shit. More blood and gore didn’t bother me. It was all fiction after all. 

As I got older though I really missed that social element of my childhood. I felt that I just wasn’t connecting with people who had the same interests as me. And it’s been that way for a while to be honest. 

Then, one day while browsing Reddit like I normally do right before bed I saw an advertisement for a social network called Slasher. 

The bold blood red colors of the name mixed with the spooky woods and other typical horror feel told me exactly what this was all about. A place for fans of horror to feel part of a community. 

I joined immediately, creating my profile and trying to find local people in my area that were also on the app. Unsurprisingly though, there weren’t many around. 

Next I checked the recommendations. I don’t really know for sure how the app chose the people it did, probably some complex algorithms but most of them seemed to enjoy what I did. B-movies, Dean Koontz novels and of course the walking dead. I decided to send a few friend requests and then call it a night. 

The next day, I was quite surprised to see that i had gotten a few requests to be added as a friend of other horror fans, and even a few DMs. 

“Hey love to meet other horror junkies like me! See you around” 

“What’s your favorite monster movie? Send me a link!” 

But then inevitably I started noticing some of them were just advertising or a poor attempt at trying to market an upcoming event for a small indie film or something. 

Don’t get me wrong here, I am all for supporting the creative outlets. I followed as many of them as I could when I got the requests. But I’m also strapped for cash. 

New books, movies and other horror memorabilia aren’t exactly on the top of my budget. 

So usually I would politely send a message and tell the user I really loved to see what they were working on and I could save it for future purchase. It was polite and I even went the extra step to say I would promote their work for them across other social media if I could. 

Most of them were quite onboard with this idea. I figure we all know how tight money is these days, so it was just another great aspect of the app. Meet new people, add new content to my long and ever growing wishlist of horror to buy. I didn’t see a downside. 

Then I got a friend request from someone that I will call Emerald. I don’t want to give away their real username here for a bunch of different reasons but just believe me when I say that your safety would be compromised if I did. 

Emerald didn’t have a profile pic but they did send a message to me asking if I would be interested in reading a short novella they planned to publish soon. 

I didn’t respond immediately but I saved to my wish list, thinking that it sounded like something right up my alley. 

Then I got another message from them asking if I had checked out their website yet. 

“Sorry my dude haven’t gotten around to it yet,” I responded. 

What happened next was a flurry of overreacting messages that made me a bit wary of them altogether. Here’s just a few of them. 

“Too busy to support horror? Why are you even on this app?” 

“Wtf is wrong with you! Just buy it already. I made that with blood!”

“You’re just like the rest. So smug and thinking we depend on you for anything. I made that with no need for any help.” 

“Look I’m sorry for overreacting. But I just need someone, anyone to listen to me and read this story. It’s all I have…” 

“Answer your damn messages already!!!!!!!!”

As you might have guessed, I decided to block them rather than deal with more of that type of behavior. 

I figured that was the end of that, just another bizarre encounter on the internet to be chalked away as a funny story for another day. 

But then I got another request from a new account the next day. Same person, new name. The messages were much more hateful this time. 

“So you're just going to try and push me away like everyone else? You sorry son of a bitch I hope you rot in hell.”

“You have no  idea who you are dealing with bud. I will make your life misery by ignoring me.” 

“You just don’t get it. You think this is how horror is? I will show you real horror. You will be starring in your own horror story soon. Fiction will become reality.” 

“No matter where you go or what you do. I will find you.” 

Then they attached a photo. 

It was of my house. 

This time I reported and blocked them. I felt uneasy, paranoid and confused. How could they have even known where I lived. How could they have found me. 

I sent a request to the app for help to make sure that this user couldn’t find me again. Maybe to make my account private where I couldn’t get messages unless they were my friend already? 

But then every message I got, every request I was on edge. Was this the stalker? It was unnerving. 

Eventually I had to just delete the app. This, I was sure; was the end of the situation. They couldn’t harm me anymore. 

But then the next day I got a package. It had no return address but it had that familiar red blood color  that I knew the social network was famous for. Was the person who was stalking me working for the developers? What sort of sick game was this?  

I opened it in my living room, my hands trembling as I saw enclosed what looked like a DVD and a sticky note that said “watch me before you do something stupid.” 

I put it in my player and sat rigid as I saw camera footage of myself going about my day to day activity. Then I heard breathing on the recording followed by a garbled voice. 

“Contact any authority and you die tonight. You will be my victim by sundown unless you appease the blood ritual.” 

This had to be some kind of joke right? This couldn’t be real. 

Then to show how serious they were the video cut to a feed of my house less than an hour ago. Watching me. 

I was a prisoner in my own home because of this crazy stalker. I felt isolated and unsure of what to do. I considered dialing 911 a dozen times. 

Then a desperate, and perhaps very dark thought came into my head. 

I went to my room and grabbed my smartphone, redownloading Slasher again. 

Then I sent a message to some of the more die hard horror fans that actually had their location listed on the site. 

Next I messaged the stalker themselves. 

“You want me? Then come get me bitch.” 

I grabbed a knife from my kitchen drawers and watched beyond the door for any sign of forced entry. My heart was pounding. If I timed this just right it would work. I turned off all the lights and remained perfectly still. 

Then I saw a shadow cross the lawn. It looked like a Man, standing there in some strange black costume. This had to be my would be attacker. 

Then I turned on all the outside lights to my front yard and let out a banshee scream. 

Like clockwork I heard the fans I had messaged jump out and run in fright. 

They trampled the stalker. 

I called the police soon after and explained some of the details. I made sure to leave out what I had sent the fans on Slasher though. As far as they knew it was just a burglar that was in the wrong place. 

The reality is that I had put up my address as the site for a ghost infestation and invited paranormal investigators to come and check it out that night. To be honest it was a last minute ditch attempt to diffuse an escalating situation. And I wasn’t sure it would work. 

But I’m grateful it did. I know what I did was crazy and probably wrong on multiple levels but I didn’t have a choice! 

Now, a few days after the whole ordeal I can get the app back and resume life as normal without having to look over my shoulder. 

But I should have known this would have a twist ending. It’s horror after all. 

I got another request. From someone who claimed to be Emerald again. This time I have no idea what to do or how to stop it. 

“You thought something as trivial as death would stop me? Think again.” 

I’m deleting the app and saying a prayer. Here’s hoping it’s enough. 

[320](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)Did you know almost 61% of adults are afraid of the dentist? Seriously–look it up! 61%!

It makes sense if you really think about it. I mean, all those tools, the drills, the pain! It’s not *completely* irrational. Is it really a surprise that so many people neglect their oral hygiene?

Maybe I’m just trying to rationalize my own lifelong dental phobia. See, until today, I was part of the 61%. My last check-up was a little after my eighth birthday when I bolted out of a dentist's chair crying hysterically. Oh sure, my parents tried to make me go back over the years, but I just kicked and scream until they finally relented. 

I must say: all things considered, I got off pretty lucky. I made it twenty-three years without needing a single root canal or filling. But then one morning I woke up and the pain was just excruciating; I couldn’t even eat a bowl of soup without grimacing. My husband told me ‘it had been a long time coming’ and that ‘it’s past time I faced my fears’ and blah blah blah. I said no way.

A full week passed. The pain got worse and worse. My husband kept pressing the issue, his voice growing more concerned each time. I had half a mind to start a big row over it, but in the end, I had to admit he was right. It was time to bite the bullet (pun intended).

He’d taken the liberty of finding a practice that specialized in treating anxious patients. I was too scared to make the call, so he did it for me. And wouldn’t you know it—they’d just had a last-minute cancellation and could see me right away. My husband drove us straight there.

The clinic was in a two-story, brick building with five concrete steps leading up to its double doors. Inside, there was a long, L-shaped counter, along with six plastic chairs and a white table covered with old magazines.

A receptionist with long, brown hair pulled into a tight bun asked for my details while typing away at her computer. There was something about her voice that made me stop and look at her. Something odd. As I gave her a long, penetrating stare, she just smiled and typed.

Eventually, I sighed and told myself it was just my imagination.

I sat at the far end of the room taking short, desperate inhales. My hands trembled. While I read the health-ed posters pinned to the walls, my husband rubbed my back, trying to put my mind at ease.

At one point a lady in blue scrubs appeared and handed the receptionist a clipboard. Then the two of them chatted about the weather. The lady's voice had the same odd quality as the receptionists. My gut told me something wasn't right. It told me if I had any sense I would get up, leave, and never come back. But I chalked those impulses up to nerves and picked up a magazine instead.

A few minutes later, the phone rang. The receptionist said ‘OK’, hung up, and told me to go through the door at the end of the hall. I stood up slowly, refusing to let my husband nudge me forward.

The receptionist picked up the phone and spoke in a low voice.

I heard shoes squeaking against the tiled floor then a tall, bespectacled man appeared. He gave me an inviting smile. “I won’t bite if you don’t.”

He laughed. “Pleased to meet you, I’m Dr. Johnson. I’ll be performing your check-up this afternoon. Come on in so I can take a look at you.”

I stood motionless. Dr. Johnson crossed the reception, touched me on the elbow, and led me into the hall. My husband came forward as if to follow us, but Dr. Johnson held out a hand. “It’ll be much easier if you wait here. I know it sounds a little counterintuitive but trust me. She’s in good hands. I won dentist of the year last year—even got the *plaque* to prove it!”

He laughed and nudged me in the ribs. “I’ve got a million of ‘em.”

“Are you OK with that, honey?” my husband asked.

I nodded, just wanting to get the whole thing over and done with as quickly as possible.

Dr. Johnson led me past several open doorways, towards a room lined with white cabinets. A blue, foam-core chair occupied the central space.

He took my coat and asked me to have a seat. When I hesitated, he placed a hand on the small of my back, in a reassuring sort of gesture, and guided me towards the chair. With a deep sigh, I laid back.

He gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze. “Now there's absolutely *nothing* to worry about. We’ll take things nice and slow. Try to take a few deep breaths.”

He flicked a button beside the chair. A motor whirred to life, causing me to give up a sudden yelp.

"Nothing to worry about," he said, "just the chair tilting back. I should have told you to *brace* yourself, huh?”

He laughed again.

The voice in the back of my head was still screaming ‘somethings wrong here,’ but I found Dr. Johnson's corny Dad jokes disarming and dismissed the idea.

“Say ‘ahhh’ for me.”

I frowned down at my feet while he slipped on a pair of plastic gloves.

He wheeled a stool beside the chair, stared at me for several seconds. “Now don’t you worry. I just need to have a quick look. That’s alllll I’m gonna do. Whenever you’re ready, say ahhh.”

After a long sigh, I obliged. He prodded around with his explorer, nodding every now and then. When he tapped the top left side of my mouth, I clenched my fists and distorted my face.

He pulled away. “You need a filling. And not the chocolate kind.”

“A filling?” I asked, horrified by the thought of this.

He nodded. I groaned and tried to stand but he placed a hand on my arm.

“It’s absolutely *nothing* to be anxious about. We’ll do it nice and slow.”

“Just sit back, relax, and before you know it it’ll all be over. Sound good?” He lightly nudged my arm until I lay back.

He told me to open wide, slipped a prop into my mouth, and positioned the light above my head. My heartbeat rose, forcing its way up into my temples.

My palms were clasped together in front of my stomach.

“I’m gonna need you to make a little bit of space for me,” he guided my hands towards the armrests. “There. Much better.”

I dug my fingers into the foam.

"Here we go, big inhale."

As I took a deep breath, he flicked another switch.

Iron restraints closed around the chair like a Venus flytrap, encasing my entire body. I could barely move a muscle. I tried to speak, but the prop stifled my voice.

Dr. Johnson disappeared from my field of vision. I strained my eyes to look round and saw him take a jar filled with green liquid out of one of the cabinets. With his back to me, he unscrewed the lid. He held up a pair of forceps, clicked them together twice, then thrust them into the jar.

He turned around and walked towards me. At the end of the forceps, he was holding some sort of giant larvae. It wriggled its top half back and forth, whipping its long antennae all around while making a hissing sound. I tried to scream but only managed a muffled cry. The restraints held firm, unyielding, as I fought against them.

Slowly, with a wide grin plastered across his face, Dr. Johnson placed the larvae over my mouth. I tried—and failed—to bite through the prop.

I jerked my head from side to side; the cold metal of the restraints scraped against my flesh.

The larvae probed me with its antennae, tickling my lips. A giant shiver ran down my spine. As the larvae crawled past my tongue and down my gullet, a sickening taste of vinegar stung my nostrils and caused my eyes to well up. All I could do is thrash around, feebly. My stifled scream became a twisted gurgle of fear and pain as the larvae wormed its way down my esophagus.

Bumps rose and fell in my throat. I felt a pinch at the back of my skull that extended all the way to the soles of my feet. The pinch became a sting. I squeezed my eyes closed and dug my nails into the armrests.

Suddenly, a great calm came over me. My stomach started to tickle, and I found myself stifling a laugh.

My body relaxed and I let out a long, satisfied sigh. Dr. Johnson flicked the switch again, then the restraints slid back under the chair.

I lay perfectly still—a big smile plastered across my face—while he took out his drill and worked on my filling.

Sometime later, he said, “all done,” and pulled off his gloves.

My eyelids fluttered, then I stretched out and yawned. “I can’t believe it was so painless!”

I pressed a hand against my neck, surprised by the change in my voice. The larvae squirmed around.

“That’s my specialty,” Dr. Johnson stepped back, took his glasses off, cleaned them on his top, and put them back on. “So, be sure to book a follow-up appointment with my receptionist.”

He gestured towards my neck. “About six months should do it.”

“Thank you so much Dr,” I climbed out of the chair. “You’re a lifesaver. I’m recommending you to all my friends.”

He gave a curt nod.

I crossed the room and grabbed my coat. “Actually, come to think of it, it’s been a while since my husband’s last check-up. Maybe you could take a quick look at him since we’re already here?”

Dr. Johnson checked his watch. “Sure. I think I can squeeze him in—my next appointment isn’t until *tooth-hurty*.”

[We both laughed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/jtb685) I have a twin sister.   

  
  This is one of the first things I tell people when I meet them, a core aspect of who I am : I have a twin sister.     
We're perfectly similar, two peas in a pod as my grandma used to fondly say. She was the only person in our family who encouraged our closeness, our intimacy, that unexplainable bond between two people who came to life inside the same body.   

  
  My mother has always been a very independant woman, and the mere idea of codependency makes her skin scrawl. Her whole life, she tried to instill a sense of self, of our own identity, never allowing us to dress the same or even to wear coordonated outfits, scolding any of our friends or family members who dared to call us « the twins » instead of our names.     
We never shared a bedroom, we had each our own cake at birthdays.   

  
  Nonetheless,Tammy and I grew up to be extremely close. As most twins, we were born premature, and I ended up with a series of health issues : Hachimoto's thyroiditis, asthma, various allergies and skin issues...   
My sister got it better. Apart from having to keep an eye on her pernicious anemia that sometimes acts up and leaves her exhausted for a couple of days, she's healthy as a horse.     
  When I hit some rough patchs as a kid and was bedbound, she always sneaked up in my room and snuggled with me. 

  
  This isn't to say we never argued, though. Tamsin has always been wary of me getting so much attention from the parents because of my poor health.   
When we were teenagers, she would act up, just to get them to notice her.   
She never got more than a sigh from our mom. My dad wouldn't say anything either, at least in front of me. More than once, though, I overheard him talking to her in the corridor and telling her how irresponsible she was to act up like this when my health was bad and I needed peace and quiet. 

  
  Only once did she get a real reaction from our mother. This was also the only time I ever saw my mom, the brilliant, cold-headed scientist, lose her temper.     
We must have been around 13, and once again I was sick. My sister had a dance contest that week-end, but my dad was on a work trip, I couldn't leave the bed, and my mom didn't want to leave me alone. We lived way too far away from town to decently ask any of the other parents of the dance group to come pick her up, that would have meant adding 2 hours to their drive.     
My sister was in hysterics, begging, crying, repeating that she had been reharsing for that contest for months and that it wasn't fair that I always came first.    
 “Your sister is ill, Tamsin! Can't you be a little less selfish, for once in your life? Is that the values I raised you with?”   
“But Mom! Our whole lives are centered around her, her, her! You don't even care about my contest, you don't even care about me ! I can miss an event, right? Who cares? I'm just a … spare!”   
My mom's palm landed on her face with the sound a gunshot. Mom's hand flew back to her face, and, for the first and last time, I saw my mom cry.   

  
  People are always so curious about what it's like to have a twin. If it wasn't for my friend Ana's curiosity, all I would know would be that I have a twin sister, with all the tiny joys and accumulated sorrows that such an intimate relationship with a sibling inevitably brings.   

  
  But over Christmas break, I decided to invite my friend Ana to come home with me, and now nothing feels safe anymore.     


Ana is Colombian, and one of the first people I met in college. She's warm, talks a lot, drinks even more – in more ways than one, the opposite of my calm, slightly snobbish classic Maine girl self.     
  Because of Covid, she couldn't go home to her family for Christmas, and even though I know my family isn't fond of having people sleeping over, I figured unprecedented times meant permission to bend the rules a little bit.   

  
  Our arrival was chaotic.     
I decided to drive home, and by the time we arrived I was feeling a bit ill, a feeling I recognized to be a warning of my body giving up on me once again and the promise of days stuck in bed.     
My sister, who had arrived the day before with her boyfriend, jumped into my arms, but my parents were uncharacteristically cold, a clear sign that they weren't thrilled about my sister and I bringing home guests.     
They sat us down and told us they wouldn't allow us to share beds with our guests : we were to sleep in our rooms, Ana would sleep on the couch in my dad's study, and my sister's boyfriend on the living room couch.     
“You're being ridiculous, Mom”, Tammy laughed. “You've let me sleep over at my boyfriends' since I was, what, 15? You always said sex was nothing to be ashamed of. You never even gave me the talk! And now you act all prude when I'm an adult? Ben and I live together!”   
“Wait, you didn't get the talk?” I interfered. “Why did I have to endure it and she didn't? Did you guys think I was going to sleep around more?”   
A death stare from my mom shut me down real quick.     
“This is my house, girls. My rules. Now help the guests get settled.” 

  
  Devil is in the details, the saying goes.     
  For me, it was in two innocent remarks from Ana.   

  
  The first one came at the breakfast table the next day. I had slept until 10am, a rare occurrence for me, and surprisingly I felt a lot better than the fatigue of the previous day had seemed to foreshadow.   Tammy joined us around half an hour later, looking like she hadn't slept a minute.     
“Wow, maybe it's right what they say about twins being connected and all. You two look like connected vessels, the better Tegan looks the worse Tammy does !” Ana exclaimed.   
“Well thank you very much”, Tammy yawned. “I don't even know why I feel so tired, I literally crashed down watching Netflix at like 10.”  
 “Have you checked your iron levels lately? You know you have to be careful.” I chimed in.   “I'm good, okay? I'm good. I'll just put on some make-up and I'll be fine.” I knew Tamsin enough not to push any further when she's in such a mood, so I let it go. It would have slipped my mind completely if it wasn't for Ana's second remark.   

  
  Ana won my family over in less than a day. Of course. By the end of the week we spent there, she cajoled my mom into showing her our baby pictures, and some even more embarrassing pictures from our teen years.   

On the last night, we were on the couch, just Ana and I, after everyone had gone to bed, looking through those old pictures.     
“Oh, look at that one ! Wow. It feels so weird.”   
“Ah, yeah. My mom is actually very fond of that one. But yeah, it does feel weird. It's almost like it was taken in another world, you know? I mean, technically I know I was born before 9/11, but I don't remember a world before 9/11, so, yeah.” 

  
  The picture in question is, in all objectivity, quite lovely. It was taken on a family trip to New York City. On it, I'm a cute, tiny baby in a pink onesie. My mom cradles me tenderly, looking young and beautiful, her pale skin full of freckles under the hard sun, on a terrace overlooking the city. And clear as the day, behind us, the famous skyline, the glorious Twin Towers. On the back of the picture, it reads “Mommy and Tegan, August 23rd, 2001”.   

  
  “And who is on this one?” Ana asked, pulling up a picture of a toddler in a Minnie Mouse costume.  
 “I have no idea. Even I can't tell us apart. Dad says only Mom could back then. They usually wrote it on the back though.”  
 “Ah yeah, that's you too. You guys really looked the same.” 

  
  We kept skimming through the pictures in silence for a few minutes.   

  
  I wish I could relive those minutes. They were the last minutes of true peace I've had. The last minutes of feeling safe in my knowledge that I had a healthy, normal, imperfect family, a laid-back Californian dad, a strict but loving Cornish mom, and a twin sister.     
  But Ana spoke up.   

  
  “Have you noticed there's no picture of you and your sister together when you were small? They only start when you're like, teens.”   
“Really? Well, I don't know. My mom wasn't thrilled to have twins, to be honest. She wouldn't say it that way, but you can tell it annoyed her that we weren't … More independent, I guess? More distinguishable.”   
“Yeah but no pictures at all? Isn't it weird? Who doesn't take pictures of twins together?” 

  
  Maybe I always sensed something was off, after all. Because there's no rational reason for this small comment to have created such a dooming feeling of unease in me. No reason for me to wait until Ana was asleep and to tiptoe back into the living room to look for... Something.   

  
  I think I didn't want to find anything. But I did.   
  The devil is in the details.   

  
  The way there was a picture of me and of Tammy at each event, but they never together.   
The way the sky looked way more gloomy on my picture of our first birthday than on hers. Maybe the weather changed during the day? Maybe.     
But my dad's mustache looked a bit longer, too.     
And on a picture of our mom's birthday, when we looked around 2, wasn't that a cast on her wrist she was hiding on her picture with Tammy? She didn't have one on her picture with me.   

  
  The devil is in the details, and sometimes History meets history.   
One of the biggest tragedy of the modern world, the event that unraveled the world as we know, ended up being the detail that also unraveled my own personal history.   

  
  There is a picture of Tammy on that NYC family trip.     
  My dad is holding her. On that very same terrace where the picture of my mom and I was taken, it seems.     
But some details are different.    
 My mom is standing, craddling me in her arms, her back to the balcony surrounding the terrace.     
My dad is sitting on a chair, Tammy on his lap, his back to a huge glass panel.   
Behind my mom, you can see the NYC skyline, untouched, unaware of what's to come.     
Behind my dad, on the reflection of the skyline, the Twin Towers are missing.   

  
  I left the next morning, without telling anyone about what I found.   

  
  But it was all I could think of. Nothing made sense. Of course she was my twin, we looked perfectly identical. Even now, with our dyed hair, Tammy's scar on her chin, my acne scars, our completely different styles, you could tell at first sight that we were twins.   

  
  In January, ended up convincing Tamsin to do one of those ancestry DNA testing things with me. It would be fun, I said, to know exactly where we came from.   

  
  What I did not tell her is that I also took samples from our parents. I'm not proud of how I did it. I went home for a week-end, made them hot chocolate laced with sleeping pills, and took the samples while they slept.     
  It was wrong, and immoral.    
  Do I regret it? I don't know. I feel sorry for them. But I mostly feel sorry for Tammy.   

  
  The results came about 4 weeks after I sent the samples.     
  Our ancestry itself didn't surprise me, not that I cared much about it. Mostly european, traces of South Asia in our lineage.     
  Unsurprisingly, it warned me that I had a mother, a father and a twin sister who also took the test, and gave me a link to let them know I was open to meeting them if they wanted to.     
  I had created fakes e-mail adresses for my parents' reports. No surprise in their ancestry either, and an information that their daughter had also taken the test. 

  
  Tammy's report was only delivered to her, but I asked her to mail it to me.     
  Unsurprisingly, it said she had a twin, too. But there was no mention of a mother and a father in Tammy's report.   

  
  I didn't want to believe what my brain was accepting to be true. I couldn't. I couldn't bear what it meant about my parents, about my life, about my sister.   

So I ignored it. I pretended it never happened. I rejected the thought every time it came to my mind. For weeks, I barely ate, barely slept, barely thought at all, it seemed.   

  
  I fainted on campus last week. My mom is my emergency contact, and by the time I regained consciousness she had already been called.     
“Oh my God, baby, look at you ! I'm taking you home right now, darling. You need to rest. Why didn't you call us? How long have you been so unwell?”   
I had never seen her so panicked. She refused help from the paramedics and helped me get into her car, and drove straight home.   

  
  My dad was there when we arrived. Mom went out of the car and ran to him. Thankfully, her car  door didn't close all the way, and at the cost of a huge effort, I could still make out what they were saying.    
 “Why are you still here, Matthew?” my mom hissed. “Go get her! Now!”  
 “She won't come. She... She's in Mexico with Ben”, Dad whispered. “In Mexico? What the hell is she doing in Mexico? We told her she had to tell her if she went away! And what about Covid? Is she insane?”  
 “She's an adult now, Caitlin. We knew we couldn't keep her locked away from the world. You have to accept it now. I can't... I can't keep doing this. She's my daughter, too.”   
“Don't you dare say that.”       
“She is, Cat. She's yours too. I know you care about her, I-” his voice broke down. “I know your maternal instinct is the strongest I have ever seen, and I know that extends to her too.” 

I couldn't hear what my mom responded, but I saw her shoulders shaking, and I knew she was sobbing. 

  
 So  I opened my car door.     
  Dragged myself out.     
  My dad rushed to my side :    
“Oh no, sweetheart, no, don't try to stand up, I'll get you inside the house, it's going to be ok, don't worry, Daddy's here, it's going to be fine-”  
 “It's not, Dad, it's not” I coughed. “But don't get Tammy. Please. Whatever happens... Please. It's my life. She deserves to have hers”.    
 He started crying, too. 

My dad has always been the emotional one, out of the two of them. My mom is cold-headed, but my dad cries watching commercials. We used to make fun of him for that, Tammy and I.   

  
  It's been a tough week, for sure. One of feeling my health deteriorating. One of struggling with so many contradictory feelings. One of learning things I never imagined on the people I love the most.  

   
  I don't know how it's going to go for me. We don't know I will react to regular treatments to my disease, as I've stopped taking them since Tammy was born.   

  
  I don't know if I can forgive my mom, and my dad for allowing her to do such a cruel thing. But I know she did it out of love, and didn't we have a loving childhood despite it all, Tammy and I? Didn't I have a good life, full of love, friendships, sunday morning pancakes, saturday night movies, monday morning dread, just like everyone else?   

  
  I don't know if I should tell Tammy. I don't know if I have a right to keep her in the dark. I also don't know if she's better off knowing, or not.     
  Ben and her are getting pretty serious. If he's The One, should I tell her before they try having kids? Or should I watch her attempt again and again to get pregnant, never to see her dream fulfilled? I know she already had picked the names of her kids.     
  She wants to have twins, too. She wants to have a daughter and have her middle name be Tegan.     
  Should I tell her that won't happen?   
  Should I tell my twin sister she kept me alive for years?     
  Should I tell my twin sister she is a clone?Where do I even begin?   
 


I guess this all started a little while after our move to Maple Street.  My wife and I had finally managed to save enough money for a down payment on a small house in Hamstead, our beloved little hometown.  
 


We had lived in our quaint new bungalow for a couple days and were still unpacking our things when we got a knock at the front door.  
 


Opening it up, we saw a couple standing there holding a casserole dish.  They smiled at us warmly and told us they lived next door, and were welcoming us to the neighbourhood on behalf of everyone.  
 


“Wow, that’s so nice of you,” I said to them, taking the dish they offered us.  “I’m Jordan, and this is my wife, Christine.”
 


They introduced themselves as Sarah and Greg, a married couple from next door.  We spoke for a few minutes but they didn’t seem to want to overstay their welcome.  Shortly after arriving they said they would be on their way.  
 


“Let us know if you need anything at all,” said Greg.  “I mean that.  If you need to borrow a cup of sugar, whatever, we’re happy to help out.”  
 


“Thanks, that’s really generous of you.” 
 


“Hey, that’s what neighbours are for, right?”
 


Not two weeks passed before I took them up on their offer.  
 


It’s not like I was trying to take advantage of them or anything, but I was putting together a new table and couldn’t find my tools anywhere.  It seemed like they had been lost during the move.  I just needed a screwdriver, so I went over to Greg and Sarah’s place and knocked on the door.  
 


Greg answered and said he would be happy to let me borrow a Phillips-head.  He invited me into his garage while he went to look for it.  
 


He opened the garage door and I went in to join him.  
 


Upon entering, I realized that Greg was a compulsive neat-freak.  He had labeled drawers and cabinets for everything, and I was amazed to see an assortment of hammers, axes, and saws hanging from the wall, sorted by size and type of tool.  Everything was clean and looked brand new.  His table saw had no hint of saw dust or speck of dirt upon it.  The blade gleamed like it had been freshly polished, though I could have sworn I had heard him using it just the day prior.  
 


“Wow, you’re really organized.”
 


“Well, I’m an engineer.  And I’ve been told we’re an odd breed.  I like to keep everything tidy and I like to have a place for everything.  Sarah thinks I’m a bit OCD.”
 


“Man, this is really something else.  I’ll need to buy some new tools now, I guess.  Unless we manage to find mine when we get everything unpacked.”
 


“Well, I’d recommend Ted’s Hardware Store, over on Main and 5th.  They have a good selection and their prices are pretty decent.  I like to support the local businesses rather than the big chain stores or online places, so I’ve been shopping there for years.”  
 


He went over to a tool chest and pulled out a screwdriver.  
 


“Here you go.  Just bring it back when you get a chance,” he said, handing it to me.  
 


“Thanks, much appreciated.”
 


After walking away I realized we still hadn’t returned their casserole dish.  
 


*
 


Three weeks later I saw the screwdriver sitting on my work bench.  I cringed and realized then that we still had their casserole dish as well.  
 


At least he didn’t seem to be taking it personally.  I had seen him just that morning and he had smiled and waved, acting friendly.  
 


I decided to go over to his place and bring the items back to him.  
 


When I got there, though, nobody was home.  
 


I felt awkward just leaving the items on the porch or putting the screwdriver in the mailbox, especially after accidentally keeping it for weeks longer than intended.  So instead I just took them back home and told myself I would bring them back on the weekend.  
 


Of course I forgot to do that once again.  We were busy running errands and the screwdriver slipped my mind for a while once again.  
 


I didn’t realize that Greg was upset at all, until I woke up in this dark, narrow wooden box.  
 


The same box he’d been in his garage working on for days.  He had his garage door open yesterday while sanding it and I’d asked him about it.
 


It looked like a wooden coffin, except it was smooth and had no gaps in the wood.  The thing looked sturdy and the wood was thick and strong.    
 


“For a little experiment I’m working on,” he’d told me with a grin.  “I’ll show you when it’s finished.”
 


I was trapped inside here when I woke up, feeling claustrophobic immediately in the small enclosed space.  I still had my phone but noticed that all functions on it were disabled, except for a couple of apps like this one.  
 
 
 


My breath caught like a dry lump in my throat as panic gripped every part of my body.  Pure terror like I had never felt before began to consume me.  I closed my eyes and opened them again, trying to convince myself I was having a nightmare.  I wasn’t.  
 


I could smell the fresh sawdust of the box I was trapped in, but beneath that was the aroma of wet earth all around me.  Alarm bells began to ring in my mind and I tried to convince myself that it wasn’t possible.  
 


I didn’t want to accept the fact that I had been buried alive.  
 


My head was still spinning from whatever drugs I had been unwittingly injected with.  My arm ached with a dull soreness as well, as if someone had stuck me with a large needle there.  
 


Pounding on the wood above me, I found it to be unyielding and sturdy.  There was no hint of weakness across any part of it.
 


Feeling groggy and sick, I turned on the flashlight on my phone to examine the lid of the coffin which I was trapped inside of.   
 


Phillips-head screws were sealing it shut from the inside.  Hundreds and hundreds of them.  They lined the edges, spaced barely a quarter inch apart from each other. 
 


They spelled out a message on the inside of the lid as well.
 


I used the flashlight on my phone to read the words left for me on the lid of the wooden coffin I was trapped in.  The message from Greg read as follows:
 


Dear Jordan,
 


You should have returned my screwdriver.  I didn’t care about the casserole dish, but that was my favourite screwdriver.  I needed it the other day and it wasn’t where it was supposed to be.  
 


Everything NEEDS TO BE WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.
 


YOU RUINED IT.  YOU RUINED EVERYTHING.
 


The voices told me where you are supposed to be.  
 


Underground.  In the box they said to make for you.
 


Bet you wish you had that Phillips-head screwdriver right now, don’t you?
 


-         Greg
  


I don’t know how I’m going to get out of here.  I don’t even know where I am or if anyone knows I’m gone.  
 


But the air in this sealed wooden coffin won’t last forever, I know that much.  
 


If you’re out there, Greg, I’m sorry.  You can have your screwdriver back.  Just please let me out of here.  
 


I’m begging you.  
 


I’ll be a better neighbour, I swear.  
 


I’ll be the BEST neighbour you’ve ever had.  I won’t tell anyone you tried to kill me.  
 


Please.  Please let me out of here.
 


You can borrow my shovel if you need to.
 


Please borrow my [shovel.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
  


[TCC]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)This is the story, the real story, of what happened to my older brother.

All this happened when I was 12 and Jacob was 16. It was after mom’s affair, when she and dad thought that they could put our family back together if we found someplace to start over. Mom and dad quit their jobs, pulled Jacob and I out of our school, sold our stake in the co-op where we had lived and bought a dilapidated place out in the country. They had a whole plan, that we’d bond over renovating the place ourselves, and somehow that would fix everything.

The house had a finished basement with this god-awful puke colored wallpaper - to this day I get nauseated if I encounter that shade of green - and dad had put Jacob and me to work tearing it down. We were fucking around, arguing about Star Wars and threatening to spray each other with the hot water solution. I could almost forget how fucked up our family had been for the last year, how viciously Jacob had bullied me, so maybe there was something to my parents’ idea.

Jacob suddenly stopped what he was doing and frowned over my shoulder. I laughed and didn’t turn - I wasn’t about to fall for that again - but the tone in his voice changed my mind.

“Mark,” he said, “was that door there before?”

I turned around, still half expecting to get hit in the back of the head with a wet sponge, and was surprised to see that there was, in fact, a door in the wall across the basement from us. I frowned, too, and told him that I didn’t remember there being a door there. Then I laughed and said “you’re fucking with me.” I remember that clearly because that was the last exchange I had with my brother before everything went to shit, and stayed shitty for a very long time.

Jacob ignored my incredulity and walked over to the door. He put his hand on the knob - I remember that it was a really old fashioned faceted glass knob, different from the tarnished brass knobs on every other door in the house, and pulled the door open. I got a glimpse of a dim tiled room before the door shut behind him.

I heard Jacob moving around in there for a while, some low cursing, and then Jacob told me that he had found a bathroom. “It’s really gross,” he said, “the tiles are, like, crusty with this brown shit, and the only light is just a bulb hanging from a wire, like at a truck stop.”

I don’t remember how I replied, but it was pretty obvious that Jacob didn’t hear me. A moment later, he called out “fuck, the door’s stuck.”

I think that was the moment I started to realize that something was really, truly wrong. The mysterious door wasn’t much of a problem for me - I already knew that my brain was a lump of fuck. I could sit through a lecture about my favorite school topic, fully intending to take notes, only to realize that the only thing I’d thought about for a whole forty-five minutes was the tits that Marianne Ratcliffe had grown over the summer. If you’d told me that I hadn’t noticed an elephant sitting in the middle of the basement, I would have believed you, so the idea that I could have missed a door wasn’t at all that unnerving. The thing was, though, that Jacob said that the door was stuck, which meant that he had tried it, but I hadn’t seen the doorknob on my side do so much as jiggle.

Anyway, I did what any semi-reasonable twelve year old would do; I went to get my dad. Mom and dad had obviously been arguing while they worked on the master bedroom, maybe that’s why they had sent us to work downstairs in the basement, so he was happy for an excuse to come down, even though he looked like he didn’t really understand, or believe, what I was saying.

By the time we got downstairs, the door was gone. My dad immediately jumped into full rage-monster mode, demanding to know what was going on but ranting about how I was wasting time before I had a chance to answer. I was sure that I was about to get a smack, but then we both heard Jacob’s voice, sounding thin and far away and very, very scared.

“Are you guys out there? Can anyone get the door open?”

To his credit, dad immediately got to work pulling down the wallpaper on that section of wall. He may have had some serious issues, but he did love his kids, and he loved us more than he loved the idea of living in a universe that was safe and sane and rational. He had the wallpaper off in no time, but all that stared back at him was drywall.

He went back upstairs without a word, leaving me alone with the blank wall and Jacob’s faint voice. He was describing the room he was in; I don’t know why, maybe he thought it would help us find another way in.

“The whole room is covered in tiles, white on the floor and sort of pink on the walls. There’s a door and a window, but they’re both stuck. The glass in the window is so filthy that I can’t make out anything outside, just a little light coming through. There’s a sink, but the water doesn’t run. There’s a toilet, but it’s dry and crusted, like someone took a mega dump in there like five years ago. There’s a shower, too, but no shower curtain, and the shower head is completely rusted over and there are rust stains going down the wall and all over the bottom of the tub.”

He might have said more, but he was drowned out by the sound of our parents coming downstairs. Dad’s footsteps were angry and determined and mom sounded like she was balance between panic and annoyance.

“What do you mean Jacob’s ‘stuck in the wall’. Charles, why do you have the sledgehammer. What’s going on?”

Dad went right up to the wall where I’d showed him the door was and just went to town on it, slamming the sledgehammer home again and again with a fury I didn’t know he possessed, and I’d seen him lose it. The sound was heavy, solid, not hollow at all. Soon the drywall was coming away in chunks, revealing the concrete beneath. When dad saw that, he started pulling it away with his bare hands.

The concrete was painted. The pictures were simple, angular and stylized, kind of like hieroglyphics or Mesopotamian art. It was laid out like a comic book, going from right to left instead of left to right. A young man was led to an altar and stripped naked. He lay down, apparently completely of his own free will. The priests - I guess they were priests, by the fancy clothes and headdresses they were wearing - were doing all sorts of things I couldn’t explain around the altar while the young man, the sacrifice, just lay there.

Then the angels came down from the sky. I say angels, but I don’t know. They had a basically human shape and wings and they were wearing long ornate robes, kind of like what the priests were wearing, but their heads and necks were like vultures’. They descended around the man on the altar and started to carry him back with them to heaven. Not all at once, though. They took him away in pieces, an arm, a leg, some unidentifiable viscera. They took his head last, and the wide-open mouth and eyes made it look like the head was still alive.

We stopped, staring at the wall, not sure what to do next. Then Jacob started singing.

His voice was stronger now, no longer thin or afraid, but I couldn’t understand the words. They weren’t in English or any other language I have ever heard, then or since. Jacob hadn’t been a singer, but his voice was suddenly rich and perfectly tuned. 

And then, at last, we heard the wingbeats.

Mom started crying. Dad screamed and went back to work with the sledgehammer. All I could do was stand there and listen. The singing didn’t ever seem to stop, it just got quieter and quieter until we couldn’t hear it anymore, as though Jacob was walking away, or being carried away.

We didn’t last long after that. We didn’t stay in the place, they sold it, and mom and dad split up pretty quickly. Dad started drinking again, mom joined some kind of wacky Jesus cult, and I ended up living with Aunt Jay. Dad finally managed to kill himself by driving his drunk ass off the side of a mountain and mom disappeared into a commune in Colorado somewhere - I never heard from her again.

Nobody mentioned Jacob, but we knew. To this day, there are shades of green I can’t look at, I get panic attacks if I run into a picture of a vulture, and every time I’m alone in a room I find myself waiting for the strong, slow whooshing noise of impossibly large wings.I wake up to the annoying drone of a lawnmower, and I frown before I remember I’m staying over at my sister's. I hate ground floor apartments.

I dig myself out from under the heap of blankets and leave the bedroom, desperate for my caffeine fix. An abrupt sound to my left replaces the lawnmower, startling me, and I turn to it.

I freeze when I see two men standing in the living room, as stunned as I am.

They’re dressed like exterminators, complete with uniforms, cylindrical tanks, and gas masks.

My mind whirs to the beat of my racing heart.

They have to be disguised burglars who weren’t expecting anyone to be home today.

They bypassed the security system.

I have to get someplace safe.

The apartment door is all the way across the kitchen.

The only safe option is to backtrack.

Just a second into our unforeseen encounter, I turn and dash back to the bedroom, where I lock the door and grab my phone.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“This is Zoe Park. There’s been a break-in, two men, and they’re still here.” I give the address. “It’s my sister’s apartment. She’s at work, I’m home alone and I’ve locked myself in the bedroom.”

“Alright, Zoe. You’re doing well. Officers have been sent to your location. Can you tell me what they look like?”

“They’re dressed like exterminators and are wearing gas masks.”

The doorknob rattles, and I run to the window, only to frown when I see the other “exterminator” outside. My sister chose this apartment for its robust structure, but if these guys made it past the security system, a bedroom door and window won’t be much of a challenge. I have to buy myself time.

I throw the phone on the bed and drag one of my sister’s hefty nightstands over the thick carpet until I’ve blocked the door. I then hook a scarf around the leg of the dresser and pull with all my might, sweat cascading down my face as I heave it in front of the window.

I grab the phone again, panting. “I blocked the door and window. That should give the police enough time to show up. Are they almost here?”

“You're doing well, Zoe. Can you tell me what they look like?”

“I told you, they’re dressed like exterminators and are wearing gas masks.”

“What about eyes? Hair color? Zoe, anything can help.”

“No, I couldn't catch their faces. Why does it matter? They’re still trying to get in, just come here and catch them!”

A gruff voice sounds from behind the door. “What's going on here?"

"A witness, officer," another voice replies.

"We'll handle it."

My breath freezes in my lungs, my hand pressing the phone to my ear in disbelief.

The lawnmower starts up again, louder than before, masking any further dialogue outside the room.

“The police are in on it?” I whisper, my voice taut. "Are you in on it too?"

“Zoe, close your eyes. How did your morning start today?”

“What!” I hiss, my incredulity escalating. “How’s that going to help? You're in on this, aren’t you!”

“Zoe, I’m trying to help you. Trust me. Close your eyes and imagine it's this morning. You wake up and?”

“I fucking wake up…

...to the annoying drone of a lawnmower, and I frown before I remember I’m staying over at my sister's. I hate ground floor apartments.

I dig myself out from under the heap of blankets and leave the bedroom, desperate for my caffeine fix. An abrupt sound to my left replaces the lawnmower, startling me, and I turn to it.

I freeze when I see two men standing in the living room, as stunned as I am.

They’re dressed like movers, complete with uniforms, boxes, and bandanas covering their faces.

My mind whirs to the beat of my racing heart.

They have to be disguised burglars who weren’t expecting anyone to be home today.

I take a fearful step back, and I unintentionally break the trance that'd kept us staring at each other.

“Ohh, did my sister let you in?” I blurt out before they can make a move. “You keep going! I’ll just go get changed!”

My jabbering baffles them long enough for me to make it back to the bedroom, where I lock the door and fumble for my phone.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“There are two robbers in the living room.” I give the address, my voice shaking. “It’s my sister’s place but she’s at work. I’m home alone. Please, hurry.”

“Alright, Zoe. Remain calm. Officers have been sent to your location.”

“How do you know my name?”

“It’s in the system. Zoe, can you tell me what they look like?”

“They...they’re dressed like movers, with bandanas over their faces. They know I’m h—”

A knock petrifies me as a deep voice booms from behind the door. “Ma’am, we need you to sign a waiver.”

I blink, flabbergasted. I didn’t expect them to fall for my impromptu performance. I guess I'm a better actress than I thought, and I'm more than happy to keep up the charade if it'll keep them oblivious.

“Sure!” I chirp. “Just give me a few minutes!”

“If you can sign it now, we can continue without delay.”

“You can slide it under the door, I’ll sign it and slide it right back!”

“Ma’am, please come out so we can arrange things properly.”

“Okay, I'll be right out,” I say, hoping my nerves aren’t cropping up in my tone. “Feel free to grab a drink from the fridge while you wait!”

The doorknob rattles and my heart drops. I run to the window and peek through the blinds, my heart dropping further when I see the other “mover” standing outside.

“You're doing well, Zoe. Can you tell me what they look like?”

“I told you, they’re dressed like movers with bandanas over their faces,” I reply in a tremulous whisper.

I stifle a scream when the man throws his weight against the door.

“I’ve got the police on the phone!" I yell, my voice cracking.

Instead of them bailing, as I’d hoped, the door shudders again. To my horror, the other man begins jostling the locked window.

Fear warps my voice. "Why aren't they running away?"

“You're doing well, Zoe. Remain calm. Can you recall their facial features?”

I jump with a tight whimper as a vicious slam rocks the door, and I slide under the bed, trembling.

"Please, are the police close?"

“Remain calm, Zoe. Can you recall anything about their facial features?”

“No, I can’t! They were covered!”

The abuse on the battered wood stops, and relief fills me when I see another shadow beneath the door.

"What's going on here?" a gruff voice asks.

"A witness, officer," the "mover" replies.

"We'll handle it."

A chill spreads beneath my skin, my clammy hand pressing the phone to my ear in disbelief.

The lawnmower starts up again, louder than before, masking any further dialogue outside the room.

“The police are in on it?” Panic seizes my lungs. “The police are in on it!”

“Zoe, remain calm. Close your eyes and tell me how you started your day today.”

“What!” I yell, my voice squeaking with frantic distress as the door shudders and splinters.

“Zoe, I’m trying to help you. Trust me. Just remain calm and close your eyes. Imagine it’s this morning. You wake up and?”

“I w-wake up...

...to the annoying drone of a lawnmower, and I frown before I remember I’m staying over at my sister's. I hate ground floor apartments.

I dig myself out from under the heap of blankets and leave the bedroom, desperate for my caffeine fix. An abrupt sound to my left replaces the lawnmower, startling me, and I turn to it.

I freeze when I see two men standing in the living room, as stunned as I am.

They’re dressed like painters, complete with uniforms, respirators, and rollers dripping with the red paint that coated the walls.

My stunned mind stumbles as my heart races.

One of the men lunges at me, and I scream and run back to the bedroom, where I lock the door and grab my phone with trembling hands.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“There are two strange men in the living room, painting it. I...I don’t know why they’re here.” My voice shakes as I give the address. “It’s my sister’s but she’s at work, I’m home alone hiding in the bedroom. Please, send someone quick!”

“Alright, Zoe. You’re doing well. Officers have been sent to your location. Remain calm. Can you tell me what they look like?”

“Did...didn’t you already ask me this? Did I tell you my name? Why do I feel—”

“What's going on here?" a gruff voice asks from behind the door.

"A witness, sir," another voice replies.

“Well, handle it."

My blood turns to ice and I scramble under the bed, whimpering as my clammy hand presses the phone to my ear.

“Please, help me,” I whisper through my tears.

“Remain calm, Zoe. You're doing well. Can you tell me what they looked like?”

“Th-they’re dressed like painters.”

The lawnmower starts up again, louder than before, masking any further dialogue outside the room.

"Zoe, do you recall anything about their faces?”

“No, th-they're wearing masks. Please, are the police almost here?” I jump with a terrified squeak as the door splinters. “Oh, God, please help me! They’re getting in!”

“Zoe, remain calm. Close your eyes. Tell me how your morning started today.”

The lawnmower groans louder as the door falls apart.

“Help me!” I plead between frantic sobs. "Oh, God, they’re almost in!”

“Zoe, remain calm. Trust me. Close your eyes. Imagine it's this morning. You wake up and?”

I curl into a ball, weeping as I screw my eyes shut. “I...I w-wake up…

...to the annoying drone of a lawnmower, and I frown before I remember I’m staying over at my sister's. I hate ground floor apartments.

I dig myself out from under the heap of blankets and...wait…

Why does the lawnmower sound like it's coming from inside the house?

Frowning in confusion, I leave the bedroom, my feet cold inside their slippers. The droning gets louder and louder, but it tapers off to silence the moment I enter the living room.

I freeze when I see two men standing in the center, as stunned as I am.

They’ve got chainsaws, their faces splattered with red.

My sister is there too.

All over the room.

I’ve barely registered the horrifying display before one of the men charges at me. A terrified wail blares from my throat as I hurl myself back in the bedroom, lock the door, and fumble for my phone with trembling hands.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Help, please, help,” I sob, trying to keep my quivering voice coherent. “My sister...two men killed my sister with chainsaws...please help!”

“Alright, Zoe. Remain calm. Officers have been sent to your location. Can you tell me what they look like?”

That voice.

Those phrases.

That question.

I frown in agitated despair, my breaths spasming as tears stream down my face. “What’s...what's happening? You...did we talk before?”

“Yes, Zoe.”

“Who are you?”

“I’m here to help you remember. And you’re doing very well this round. Can you tell me what the two men look like?”

“What's going on here?" a gruff voice asks from behind the door.

"A witness, sir," another voice replies.

“Well, handle it."

The chainsaws start up again, cutting through the door, and I scurry under the bed, whimpering as my clammy hand presses the phone to my ear.

“Please, help me,” I whisper through my tears. “Are the police almost here?”

“No, Zoe. They didn’t make it in time.”

“They’re not going to make it?” I squeak in panic.

“No, Zoe, they *didn’t* make it.”

“Wh-what?”

“You've already been through this seven months ago, Zoe. You’re in a coma now. We’re stimulating your last memory in hopes of identifying your attackers and your sister's killers."

My fitful breaths puff against my trembling veil of hair. "Th-this a memory?"

"Yes, Zoe. We apologize for stimulating it multiple times, but our technique is not immune to memories altered by trauma, disbelief, guilt, and grief."

I flinch as shards of wood explode across the room, the chainsaws' roars deafening.

I stifle a sob. "I s-survived this?"

"Yes, you're a fighter. And the doctors have done a wonderful job making sure you'll live a decent life once you regain consciousness and undergo therapy. Zoe, do you recall what the men who killed your sister and attacked you look like?”

I clench my jaw, determination slicing its way through my nauseating fear. “...yes...”

…

“Zoe?"

I open my eyes at the familiar, soothing voice.

“Hello. I was told you regained consciousness. I've waited two years to finally meet you in person...outside of your head. You did very well.”

[SR](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkittishReflections)Sorry, I took a few days off.  Shockingly, typing and reliving [what I went through](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/m4ap4z/my_dad_was_a_famous_author_who_abandoned_his/) was not good for my mental health. I’ve been told by multiple people not to do this, but it helps to get everything out.

I guess in a way, I’m just like my dad. I’m writing this like a novel, like this is fiction – when it’s not. This really happened. This isn’t some Harry Potter shit with a happy ending.

Anyway, I’m sorry about the last post ending so abruptly, much like this one probably will too. Sometimes it gets too much. I have to separate myself from the memories, and it’s hard. It’s fucking hard to do that when they never leave me alone, and writing is my only outlet. It’s the only way I can release all this shit inside my head that I can’t talk about. When I try, it’s like my body goes into shock. I start sweating and I can’t breathe. I can’t speak. I have to get out of that therapist’s office before I tear off her head or my own. People deal with trauma in different ways, right?

Well, until I worked up the courage to post on here, all I’ve done is struggle. I’ve struggled to wake up to a new day that is normal for everyone but me. I struggle to eat the food I used to love. I struggle to tell my little sister I don’t want her help.  I’ve spent most of the time sleeping, but my laptop’s been gathering dust on my desk. My novel is a no-go. I’m never writing again, at least creatively.

I’m sure you can understand why. However, I do like typing. It’s therapeutic to me, and better than using a pen.  Right now, you’re my only outlet. You’re all faceless. Nameless.

You can’t help me, not now at least. But that makes it better. It’s better than talking to real people who make sympathetic faces and try and help, but don’t. None of them fucking help.

My mom is making it worse. Maria is trying to make me happy but she’s naïve to think sitting on the side of this bed and playing board games and watching all my favourite shows with me will help – it won’t. They’re all completely hopeless. They can’t fucking help me. So screw their therapy and the medication they try and shove down my throat. All I need is my laptop and my father’s apparent talent that runs through my fingertips. All I need to do is write. Then everything will be better. I’m just going to write, and the nightmares will stop. I’ll stop thinking about him.

I’ve never liked apple juice. It’s always been too strong. Too sweet. Every time I’ve drank it in my life I’ve felt sick afterwards, and it leaves a weird taste in my mouth. In my opinion, the drink sucks. It always has and always will. It’s the worst of the worst and nothing can ever change my mind.

That fact did not matter, however. Because a YouTube clip exists of an eight-year-old me sipping on a sour apple juice box at one of my dad’s book signings. I may have supressed most of my younger years to the back of my head, but this one is in clarity. I remember being thirsty. Really thirsty. There were bottles of water, but when I asked a security guard for one, they just laughed in my face and shoved a juice box at me. I didn’t like dad’s security guards. They were tasked with babysitting me during the signing, but they just left me with a Nintendo DS which was almost out of battery and an apple juice box. It was in a small bright yellow carton with a grinning carrot on the front.

It became a sort of comfort. An anchor. After finishing it, I’d started chewing on the straw. When the straw had started spiking me in the mouth, I’d removed it and chewed on the carton itself. It tasted of cardboard but I didn’t care. It was something to do. Besides, I didn’t want to watch my dad hugging fans when he hadn’t hugged Maria or I since Seventeen was published. So I guess it was aggravated chewing. Unfortunately, this was caught on film. So, if you search **MATTHEW JOHNSON – SEVENTEEN BOOK SIGNING** in YouTube, you will most likely see little me in the background, gnawing on a chewed up juice box. I didn’t stop until dad’s manager had snatched it off me and replaced it with an iPad. Something to keep my hands busy, I guess. They were probably pissed that I didn’t smile or look excited like every other kid at the signing.

Like I said, I don’t like apple juice. However, thanks to that one video, apparently it’s my favourite drink.

According to Alyssa, at least.

The zip ties pinning my arms behind my back were cutting into the flesh of my wrists. I could feel Olivia’s blood staining my hands. It was warm, coagulating under my fingernails. Her body was next to me in the dark and thank god I couldn’t see it. Thank god I had been  given just a slither of mercy.

Despite being unable to see her, however, I knew she was there. I knew she was dead, and there was nothing I could do. It took every single ounce of willpower I had not to cry out. I couldn’t cry out. That was my mindset, at least. I couldn’t look weak in front of my kidnappers. The movement of the van was sending my stomach into my throat, so I kept my head sandwiched in my lap.

I don’t know how long I stayed in that position, with my eyes squeezed shut against the dark, cursing anyone I could think of. I cursed my father for writing the stupid book in the first place. I cursed Finn for getting himself kidnapped. I cursed myself for falling directly into Cookbook Girl’s trap and leaving Olivia at her mercy. I don’t know what she did to Olivia, but I hoped my friend didn’t suffer. I hoped to god it was quick.

“Cole! I have a surprise for you!”

The girl’s voice dragged me out of cotton candy thoughts and I nearly gave myself whiplash looking up. My vision had adjusted to the dark, and I could just about make out her figure in front of me. I felt her heavy breath on my face, tickling my cheeks. I shuffled back, biting back a yell. I could still feel Olivia tainting me, coating me like paint. She was fucking everywhere, and I couldn’t get her off my hands. 

Alyssa must have noticed me trembling, because something plastic grazed my lips. I recognised it automatically. It was a straw. When I shook my head and tried to lean away, she shoved it in my mouth.

“Are you thirsty?” her voice was soft, and I could feel her inches from me. It wasn’t just me who was shaking. She was too. But not with fear. It was excitement. Exhilaration. The girl was practically vibrating with glee. When I didn’t respond, instead giving my restraints a half-hearted tug, something cold and sour was filling my mouth and sending my thoughts into a tailspin.

I gagged, but something told me spitting it out wouldn’t be a good idea. My throat burned when I swallowed it, but Alyssa gave an appreciative giggle. Maybe apple juice had changed flavours since I was a kid, but I swear there was something else in it. Something that gave it an extra kick, a sort of metallic after-taste in the back of my throat. Noticing this, I tried to hold it in my mouth.

Again though, the girl was determined.

She grabbed me by the back of my head, fisting strands of my hair and ragging me like a doll. I felt her lips against my ear once again, nibbling on the lobe. Her breath was hot and heavy when she yanked my head back. “Cole, we were courteous enough to get your favourite juice-box despite your father ruining our lives, so I suggest you drink the *fucking* juice, or I’ll gut your other friend too.”

My reaction must have satisfied her. I remembered Olivia covering me like I was Alyssa’s canvas, her blood dripping down my back and staining the backs of my hands. She was everywhere. And only hours ago the two of us had shared toasted poptarts, with her excitedly telling me about adopting a puppy in the fall. I gulped down the juice so fast I almost choked. It was lukewarm and sour, laced with her own forbidden poison. Maybe it was guilt that made me comply.

“Is Finn important to you, Cole?”

Yes. I thought. More than I wanted to admit. Thankfully, she didn’t expand on that. While I was swirling that thought around my head, what exactly Finn meant to me, something came over me like a wave of warm water. Gentle. Soothing. It filled my brain with molasses and numbed my lips. I knew what it was automatically, but I couldn’t panic. It was shutting off parts of my brain that panicked, sending me careening into the back of my own mind. When I moved my head I was treated to a neutron star collision at the backs of my eyelids. Alyssa had spiked the juice-box. My head lolled to the side on its own accord, and my eyes grew heavy like weights. See, I’m not good at this stuff. Description.

I’ve always liked writing dialogue, and from what my dad told me, he was always description heavy. I can only really remember the sensation of being drugged like a fever dream. My skin prickled with heat, and yet I was shivering. I couldn’t move my head no matter how hard I tried, and my mouth felt like it was full of cotton candy. The only thing I was aware of were the words trying to escape my lips, but they were scrambled and wrong, and I couldn’t reach them. Alyssa was still in front of me. Slipping in and out of consciousness, my body swaying to the sound of her sharp breaths. The van’s jolting movements sending me tipping side-to-side.

At some point Alyssa’s warm hands would stroke up and down my arm, her fingernails grazing my skin. “Can we talk?” her tone was sweet and sultry, and I all I really wanted to do was punch her in the face. But I was helpless. I had no choice to listen to her, while my cotton candy thoughts escaped me. I didn’t think about Olivia, or Finn, or my father.

Instead, I was plunged into the universe of Seventeen, its world exploding into my mind in full HD colour, and I was subconsciously stitching the characters together. The plot. The villains. 

All of my father’s creations were finally coming to life for me, and it was purely against my will. I didn’t want to see them. I didn’t want to imagine Sia’s hair described as liquid gold, or the crown of glass Kai was made to wear in book two—or that Luna wore red ribbons in her hair as a sign of remembrance for her mother. I didn’t want any of it, but it’s not like I could stop her. It’s not like I could open my mouth and tell her to stop. My lips were numb. My tongue felt bloated and wrong, too big for my mouth.

I’d like to say Alyssa went on for days. That’s what it felt like, at least. God, it felt like days of torture. While I wallowed in the dark, wrestling with my own tongue, my words like alphabet soup, she went through all four books, and bizarrely—I’d liked to say this was because I was drugged—but I wanted more. It seems crazy to write this now, but at the time I wasn’t exactly thinking straight. My thoughts weren’t my own. The more she talked, I listened. I stopped bleeding in and out of reality and stayed anchored by her voice.

While I felt like I was flying, hopping from cloud to cloud, the jarring movements of the van sending my stomach catapulting—Alyssa went through the final book, starting with a tone that reminded me of the windchimes on the door to Moira’s reads and progressing into what I could only describe as a hysterical screech. 

Every name, whether it was a protagonist or a villain, hit the air with emphasis and venom. The Seventeen fans were right about one thing. Dad *did* leave the fourth book on a cliff-hanger with no hint at resolution; the four mains at a standstill, with two of them seemingly confessing their love for each other, and the other love interest bleeding out on the floor, shot by the fan favourite. Luna. Who had been kidnapped and brainwashed to join the dark side. Alyssa went quiet after that. I don’t know if she joined the others, or maybe my brain just tuned her out.  I was left to the dark, to break apart in the painful white noise enveloping me in oblivion.

But it wasn’t dark for long. Because my mind wasn’t done playing with me. And filled with Seventeen, it was all I could about.

When my body started responding to me, and allowed me to look up, I glimpsed familiar blonde curls glowing in the dark. Liquid sunshine, I thought dizzily. Eyes the colour of bluebells. Skin as white as snow. That was how my father, and then Alyssa, had described Sia Montgomery. And there she was. Not Alyssa. Not the crazy fan cosplaying as the character—I was seeing Sia.

I was seeing the cartoon version of her on my father’s books; the beautiful illustration I had never really fully appreciated, except thinking it was pretty dope. She loomed over me, dressed in the white dress that Alyssa had spoken of, golden hair billowing, and eyes sizzling with an energy I couldn’t make sense of. Sia looked like she was dipped in moonlight, an aura of dizzying white light surrounding her. I knew I was hallucinating. 

I knew she was the result of whatever the hell Alyssa had put in the drink. For a moment I could only stare at her, marvelling how intricate her outline was, cartoon crayon bleeding into the dark. Sia’s expression was amused. Though I couldn’t blame her. I was her creators son and had managed to get myself kidnapped by his psycho fans. Her brow was raised, lips curled. “Well?” she folded her arms, leaning close. She felt real. At least to me. I felt her breaths grazing my cheeks. Maybe it was Alyssa, and I was building Sia on top of her.

“Well what?” I slurred, glaring at the character.

Sia rolled her eyes. “Aren’t you going to do something?”

When I shook my head, she pressed her head against mine. “You’re Matthew Johnson’s son.” She gestured to my bound wrists, “Come on, Cole. Your dad wrote a whole scene about escaping from restraints. Remember when Nico was captured by the the Hendrix? They tied him up, but he got out.”

At the back of my mind, I knew this wasn’t Sia talking. This was me. I knew my dad had never read Seventeen to me. However, Alyssa had. And I’d picked up on that specific scene. But there was one problem. Nico had supernatural powers. I didn’t. Nico had been bound in enchanted ropes he could loosen just by muttering a spell. My restraints were zip-ties. They fucking hurt, and they definitely wouldn’t come apart if I started muttering abracadabra and hocus pocus. Settling Sia with a glare, I tugged at the sharp plastic slicing into the flesh of my wrists.

Part of me wanted to talk to her. Eight-year-old me wanted to know why she had taken my father from me. Why she had turned my father into a shell of the man he used to be. But I was done. 

At least with my younger self. I had gotten over dad leaving, and asking her, even if she was a hallucination made up of painful memories, was a bad idea. I pushed all of that to the back of my head, before I could let my younger self take control. “What the fuck do you expect me to do, huh?” I hissed out loud. “I don’t know why you’re looking at me like that.” Tears welled in my eyes and that only made her smile brighter.

She was teasing me. Sia only cocked a brow and exhaled out a breath. “How are you and your father even related?”

That was the last thing Hallucination-Sia said before fading away before my heavy eyes. When she was gone, the lights in the van flickered on, and the first thing I saw was red; smears of crimson decorating the floor I was sitting on. I had barely enough time to register it before Alyssa was diving in front of me once again. “You’re all bloody!” she was giggling, tugging at my work shirt stained vicious red.

I was coloured so many shades of red, and I couldn’t fucking breathe. So I focused on the slumped form of my best friend in the corner. Finn was sitting with his back to the rattling shutters, his head tipped back, brown hair falling in closed eyes. His mouth was still covered in layers of duct tape, and my heart sank. 

I just wanted to talk to him; to ask if he was okay, to apologise to him. *I’m so fucking sorry,* I wanted to say. The words were there, but I couldn’t say them. Not when there was a psycho in front of me. Alyssa was still pulling and tugging at my shirt, running her hands over the stitched crest. “We’re going to get you all cleaned up, okay?” she hummed, her eyes sparkling. Chills tiptoed down my spine when her nimble fingers worked quickly, unfastening my collar. “Red doesn’t look good on you, Cole.”

Her words made me nauseous. “Olivia,” I said softly, my voice shaking. “You killed her.”

“Mmm. And if you don’t do what I say, I’ll kill the other one too!” Alyssa looked me up and down, her blue eyes narrowing into slits. “You need a bath and some fresh clothes. After all, you need to look good for when you go home.”

My stomach knotted. “Home?” I asked too hopefully. But I already knew what she meant. She didn’t mean my real home where Maria and mom were probably worried sick about me. Alyssa meant my old home. The one I barely remembered.

“Yep!” This time the driver, or Tom, yelled from the front. “According to the official Seventeen subreddit, your father hid away a finished manuscript for book five in your old house. Apparently, he hid it in plain sight. The house was never bought by anyone, so it’s been abandoned for years. But it’s a well known fact that Matthew Johnson didn’t just finish book five. He hid it away, as punishment for fans sending him abusive fan-mail,” Tom paused for effect. “One of the top posts of all time is a blueprint of the house. A lot of fans are convinced it’s inside his old office under the desk.”

I wanted to twist around and face the asshole, but the floor was covered in Olivia. And I didn’t want to see her. I didn’t want to see what the bastards had done to my friend. Instead of facing Tom, I focused on Alyssa, who was staring at me like I was the fucking coming of Jesus. Maybe I was. Maybe Seventeen was some ancient scribe disguised as a YA novel. “There is no book five.” I spat. “There’s no conspiracy surrounding my father and a so-called secret manuscript. You’re wasting your time.”

“Huh.” Tom chuckled. I could hear Cookbook Girl, or “Lizbeth’s” giggling too. “That’s funny. You talk as if you actually know anything, considering daddy dearest abandoned you, your mother, and your little sister Maria at the age of eight.”

I had to laugh, though it came out more like a sob. His words were like razors skimming down my back.

“Don’t you have jobs? School?”

“Our jobs are bringing a conclusion to Seventeen!” Lizbeth sang.

“Oh, yeah?” I challenged. “What if I told you the police are probably looking for us right now?”

“I don’t think so, sweet pea!” Alyssa wound her fingers in strands of my hair once again, giving another sharp tug. That time, I couldn’t hold back a cry. But she didn’t loosen her grip or give mercy. Her hold on me was relentless. “After the two of you make phone-calls to your parents explaining you’re going on a road trip, you are going to go and get the manuscript from your house, accompanied by me of course—” I cut her off. “There’s no way my mom would let me go on a—”

My words hit the back of my throat when the girl tightened her grip. “And then we’re going to look through it, see what we like and what we don’t like, what we’ll change and what we’ll keep, and then we will have you, Matthew Johnson’s son, his legacy, write the ending we deserve. Which of course includes Luna, Nico, Kai and Sia in the ship pairings that WE want. How does that sound?” When I didn’t reply, she laughed and let me go. “Trust me, we’ll laugh about this when we’re all friends!”

“Friends?” I choked out.

“Just go with it!” Tom shouted from the front. “You don’t want to make Lissa mad.”

My scalp was stinging. “What happens if I refuse?” I challenged.

“You said it yourself. I’m the so-called ‘legacy’ of Seventeen, according to you lunatics. If you kill me, the book dies with me.”

Alyssa’s lips curled into a smile, and she held up something drenched in red. Something that used to be blue. She waved Olivia’s work-shirt in front of me. “Cole, baby, I think you know what happens if you refuse.” She sang, her gaze snapping to Finn. “He’s collateral for a reason. And from the look of the way you’re eyeing him, I don’t think you want to lose Kai.”

“Finn.” I said, “ His name is Finn.”

“I like Kai better! But just this once I’ll play your game.”

The second the words had left Alyssa’s mouth, Finn let out a groan, muffled by the tape over his mouth. His body seemed to jolt awake, and he lifted his head slowly, brown eyes blinking open. He looked confused for a moment, eyes widening, lips moving under the tape, before catching my eye.

I can’t describe the look he gave me because it hurts thinking about it. I can only say pain mixed with reassurance. *It’s okay.* He was telling me with his eyes. Which killed me. Finn was trying to tell me everything was going to be okay with his expression, when I was the reason we been snatched. I couldn’t look at him. I couldn’t look at the worry lines creasing in his forehead, and the raw looking welt under his right eye.  

The fact that Finn was awake seemed to thrill Alyssa, and the girl crawled over to him.  He started to shuffle away, especially when his bambi-like eyes caught the splashes of red coating the floor. “Speak of the devil!” she laughed. “Sleeping beauty is awake!”

The girl’s smile was wide like a shark.

“Finn Michaels!” she squealed, “It’s so amazing to meet you in the flesh!”

Finn muffled something, his eyes darkening.

Alyssa cocked her head. “Oh, right! You want to speak?” she tapped her chin thoughtfully. “Are you going to be a good boy, Finn Michaels?”

He nodded, his muffle-speak getting progressively more aggressive.

“Well, okay then!” Alyssa reached out and ripped the duct tape from Finn’s mouth, and he let out a shriek of pain.

“Let us go,” Finn gritted out. He leaned forward in his bindings, wincing. “We have nothing to do with that book.”

Alyssa only let out a hysterical squeak. “Talk again!” she shrieked, “You have the perfect voice for Kai! Even his accent!”

Finn inclined his head. “You’re kidding me, right?” He shot me a look. “This is what we’re dealing with? Your dad’s loony fans? Didn’t that book die out years ago?”

The sound of Alyssa’s palm striking my friend’s cheek made me cringe.

“Ow!” He yelped, “Cole, what the fuck? Are these psycho’s serious?”

“Yeah.” I managed to say, and after a pause, “They killed Olivia.”

Finn’s gaze wavered, his expression flashing between confusion, denial, anger, and pain.

Alyssa’s smile broadened. Finn’s eyes were raw and I’m sure he was crying, trembling under the rock hard façade he had built around himself. “See!” she squealed, jumping up.

“What did I tell you? Finn is the perfect Kai!” she threaded her fingers through strands of his reddish brown hair before turning to me, yanking my friend’s head back. She liked doing that; treating us like we were her own personal fucking dolls. Finn didn’t speak, but his lips were curved into a grimace.

“What do you think, Cole? Should we make him a crown of glass just like Kai’s? I’ve seen so much fan art of it, and I’d love to see it in real life!” I couldn’t help staring at Finn’s hair bleeding through her fingers and imagining jagged pieces of glass sticking from his head. I shook away the thought before it could envelope me. The drugs were still fucking around with my head.

“I think it’s a great idea!” Alyssa was talking to herself, and I caught a conspicuous smile cross her lips. She still had hold of my friend’s hair, running her fingers through his curls.

“Why don’t we give him Luna’s storyline?” When I didn’t reply, the girl ragged Finn’s head once again. “Luna being kidnapped and enslaved by Hendrix was the worst thing your father has ever done, so I figured why not give the plot to Kai? After all, he’s the worst character. Nico and Sia belong together. Kai is just in the way. And besides, his powers weren’t even natural. He doesn’t even belong in the Seventeen Circle. Everyone knows that.”

I swallowed hard. “Knock yourself out,” I said shakily, “You’re the ones writing it, not me.”

“Uh-huh!” Alyssa’s smile was getting progressively more unnerving. “But I was thinking, since we really need you to compromise with us, Cole. What if we do to Finn exactly what happened to Luna?”

My mouth went dry. Thanks to her Storytime while I was hopped up on whatever the hell she’d fed me, I could still vaguely remember key plot points. With one being the most controversial; Luna Marigold, Seventeen’s beloved character. After going into the Hendrix labs undercover, with the mission to find out the secret behind the army of children Luke Hendrix was building, she had been captured.

But it wasn’t a normal capture. Luna had been forced to the dark side, after Hendrix had drilled into her skull, inserting an enchanted device that enslaved her thoughts and left her with no free will. Officially Hendrix’s henchwoman, Luna had launched an attack on the Seventeen Circle and shot Nico, leaving Sia and Kai to realise they had hidden feelings all along. None of that mattered, however. None of it was real except what happened to Luna.

Which was now what Alyssa wanted to do to Finn.

Before I could speak, she was whipping out a tiny piece of metal. It was barely the size of her thumb. Still holding Finn by the scruff of his scalp, she ran her fingernails over the back of his skull. “We’re going to make Finn feel better,” she giggled, “Just like in the book we’re going to drill a nice little hole inside his brain, and then we’ll stick this in. Just like with Luna.”

“No.” I was speaking before I could stop myself, choking on stolen breath. “No, Alyssa, that’s fiction. You’ll—”

Kill him, I wanted to scream.

You’ll kill him!

The words would not come out. I didn’t even want to taste them. I didn’t want to chance the possibility of losing him.

“I’ll what?” Letting go of Finn, she moved to me. I blinked once. Just once. And once again the cool steel of her pistol was protruding into the flesh of my forehead. Her fingers teased the trigger. “I hate it when you stutter,” She giggled. “You’re Matthew Johnson’s son and you can barely speak. Why don’t we try that again, hmm? What were you going to say?”

The weight of her gun sent the words spiralling. I swallowed them down with a sob.

“Nothing.” I managed to choke out.

“Mmm hmm. And what is this in my hand?” she held up the piece of metal. And it was just that, a sliver of metal, probably something she had picked up off of the floor.

“Cole.” Finn hissed out. “Just go with what she says.”

My whole body had gone boiling hot. “It’s a—a mind control device,” I stumbled over my words. Seeing Finn’s expression, and knowing what they were capable of,  after what they had done to Olivia, motivated me to continue on, struggling to breathe. “Uh, you should know that the scene with Luna wasn’t actually drilling into her head. The, um.. the device, it was implanted behind her ear instead.”

My brain was working to fix whatever the crazy bitch planned to destroy. Implanting the piece of metal behind Finn’s ear would be dangerous, of course it would be. He could get an infection or lose blood from the incision. However, that outcome was far better than what was planned. Which sounded like a backstreet lobotomy.

“It was?” Alyssa was intrigued. That’s all I needed. I just needed her to go along with it.

“Yes!” I struggled to straighten up. “In a deleted scene that my dad took out, it showed the surgeon deciding to go with the implant behind the ear. You know, so it was less messy, and it wouldn’t actually be permanent for the character.”

Keep going, I told myself. I caught Finn’s eye.

*Stop*. He was pleading with his eyes.

“False!” Lizbeth cut in from the front of the van. “Matthew Johnson did a Q&amp;A in New York a few months before he went missing. He said he hated what he did to Luna, but he didn’t regret it. He said he was always going to have her either dying or losing her mind.” Lizbeth’s voice grated my ears,. "Plus! Your father spoke of no deleted scenes. Especially in book four.”

Alyssa turned back to me with wide eyes. “So you lied, huh? You didn’t strike me as a liar, Cole Johnson.”

“No!” I squirmed in my bindings. “Look, I’ll do anything you want, okay? Just, please. Leave Finn out of it.”

The girl hummed. “Why though?” she studied me, a smile curving on her lips. “Cole, am I right to assume what everyone else has been thinking? I mean I knew it was just speculation on the sub, but I didn’t think it was real!”

“Back off.” My voice was choked up. “You’re here because of my dad’s book. Not me or Finn, or our lives.”

A shadow fell over her expression. “I’m sorry, we don’t swear here. This is a no swearing zone.” When I tried to lean away, she was inches away from me. “Your father once said in an interview that we must only speak with beautiful words. And write beautiful words.” This time, she pressed her lips against mine. It wasn’t a kiss, however. It was more of an act of marking territory. “If you swear again, I’ll make you regret it,” she murmured into my lips, before twisting around and grinning at Finn. “Or I’ll make you regret it by hurting him.”

“You’re swearing,” Is all I could say with the gutter of my throat, “Pretty hypocritical if you ask me.”

She nodded. “Oh, we can swear, Cole. But not you. Like I said, you are the creator of Seventeen’s son. I don’t want you spewing garbage. I only want pretty words from you, Cole. Beautiful words. And you’re going to give us all of those beautiful words in the form of Seventeen’s fifth book.” 

She cocked her head and it was innocent. Childlike. The van ran over a pot hole, and the two of us were thrown to the side. But Alyssa barely seemed fazed. A rose fell from her hair, delicate and soft. I watched it land in splashes of crimson decorating the floor. She reached out and caressed my cheek, a dreamy smile on her lips. “Are we in understanding with each other? I promise not to make too big of a hole in Finn’s brain, okay? I won't make a mess. I've done plenty of trials on the other one!"

Olivia.

I bent over when my stomach ricocheted. But I couldn't barf.

“Please.” I was whimpering, “Alyssa, you know my dad’s books are fake. You-- you'll kill him!"

“They’re what?” she hummed. “Sorry, I don’t think I heard you.”

“Fake.” I repeated. “They’re fake! They’re not real!”

“Then I suppose what I do to Finn won’t be real either, will it? Now, are you going to get us the manuscript or not?”

Once again, her lips were on mine. “Are you going to be a good boy?”

“You’re embarrassing yourself.” I murmured, “If you have any dignity left, you will quit while you’re at it.”

“But what if sweet Kai’s life was on the line, hmm? Do you want us to spare him?”

I knew her words were too good to be true. Still though, I felt an overwhelming compulsion to do what she wanted.

The feeling of her fingers grazing my cheeks made me want to barf. I could only nod. I was nodding, and I didn’t fucking know why. It was naïve of me to think agreeing to her demands would make her leave my friend alone. Oh no, she wanted more. Not just the book. Not just my dad, and an ending she thought she deserved. Alyssa wanted to make me hurt.

She wanted me to scream. Once she was done torturing me, I rang my mother on my phone and told her everything was okay; that the three of us were going on a road-trip. Mom didn’t ask why. 

She just told me she loved me, and that if I was going to look for dad—I’d be setting myself up for disappointment. When I was done, Finn was told to ring his father. Though he got the reply I wanted. The one I’d always wanted; disappointed and pissed off parent demanding to know why Finn was dropping out of school in the middle of his junior year. But Finn managed to reassure him, promising he’d call regularly, and that he loved him. I wanted mom to say that. *I love you.* Except she just muttered something about keeping safe and wearing sunscreen.

The hours went by in a blur.

At some point, I don’t know when, Olivia’s body was disposed of. They threw her into a river like she was nothing.

I tried to talk to Alyssa. I tried to talk her out of her insane plan.

But she just laughed. Tom blasted music. Lizbeth read out DIY articles on Yahoo answers on how to lobotomise someone.

Finn was force-fed the drugged apple juice, and Alyssa hauled his unresponsive body to the floor, straddling his hips. I should probably add that I wasn’t just sitting there and letting them do this. I was screaming. I was screaming so loud my throat was aching. My chest was heaving. I was crying. But they ignored me. They were loving it; watching me beg for Finn’s mercy. I guess that’s what they wanted all along. They wanted to hurt me, just like my father had hurt their characters.

The others passed Alyssa objects that at first I couldn’t register; a scalpel, a pair of gloves, and what looked like a bone saw. Finn’s eyes were flickering. He was barely awake, muffling under a fresh layer of duct tape. It was only when Alyssa stuck the blade of the bone saw into his right temple, did he finally seem to come to, squirming under the crazy girl’s weight.

Alyssa turned to me.  “Okay, Cole! Are you going to get us the manuscript?”

“Yes.” I remember saying it. The word was so prominent in my mouth. Even when I was so sure that it didn’t exist. That these crazy fans were chasing a pipe dream. And neither Finn, nor I, was getting out alive.  *Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.*

I was still saying it, screaming it at the top of my lungs, my heart lodged in my throat, when the drilling started.There had been a bank robbery in Habitsville—an actual, real life bank robbery in my hometown—and I couldn’t have been happier.  

I’m sorry, maybe that was a little insensitive. Of course, I’m not *pro-crime*—but as a small-town newspaper reporter whose job is too often limited to new library branches and high school sports, this is the most interesting work week I could hope for. 

Besides, I might be overselling it a bit, to call them bank robberies. Yes, they took place in a bank—The Bank of Habitsville, to be specific. Yes, all three incidents happened at the same building, only a few days apart. And yes, there was breaking and entering in the dead of night, by anonymous criminals that wiped security camera footage. But this isn’t quite Ocean’s Eleven. 

The ‘robbers’ always broke into vault 713, and they never took any money.  

Each break-in happened at midnight, and each triggered the bank’s alarm systems, both for the building itself, and for individual vault, so it was fairly easy to find where the strangers had been, even without any sort of security tape evidence. 

After the first one, the money was counted frantically—the biggest heist we’d ever seen in Habitsville was kids swiping candy from the gas station—so no one was prepared for an actual set of prepared criminals to make off with the savings of private citizens. 

But, like I said, none of the money was missing. Police thought it was the most curious thing, that someone would go to all of that trouble only to leave the vault exactly how they found it. Until, after the third break-in and the third re-counting, they realized the contents of the vault weren’t how they had always been. 

There, inside the vault, was something new. 

At first, it was difficult for me to get any information. It’s not odd for the police to be a bit hush-hush with members of the press, but something about this felt different—*nobody* seemed to know anything, and the low-level officers I approached weren’t stand-offish or secretive—they just seemed as clueless as I was, insisting ‘other’ officers were involved with the case, not them. 

Then, the strangest thing happened. I was invited to the bank. 

Now, there are two reasons the Habitsville Police Chief would call me, Samuel Singer, to the scene of a mysterious crime. One, is to take flattering pictures of cops working hard on the case for the newspaper, so the townspeople feel like something’s being done.

The second, is because they’ve read some of my *other* work. My stories about strange murders, horrific sights, and all of the peculiarities I’ve found within the limits of our small town. 

When I arrived at the bank the next morning and found it completely deserted, I knew which reason it was. 

There was an eerie stillness in the air, like the moment rain suddenly stops after a storm. All the evidence of activity was there—police cars with headlights on, some with doors opens—but the actual people were nowhere to be found. 

I walked along the perimeter of the building full of unease.  Had it been some sort of prank? Was I not really supposed to be there? The voice on the phone had seemed legit, very authoritative and police-like—no, something very much unplanned had happened there. 

My footsteps echoed off the marble floor, scuffed with the morning’s traffic, but still, no one seemed to be in the bank’s lobby either. The armchairs and small couches in the waiting area were empty, and no faces looked back at me from behind the teller’s plexiglass. 

“Hello?” I called out, but the only answer I got was my own voice bounced back to me. I began to walk, peering around corners, and eventually, moving towards the door next to the teller’s stations, the one that read: **EMPLOYEES ONLY** in big black letters. The door must lead to the rest of the bank, and perhaps to the people who invited me here. 

I turned the handle, and to my surprise, it gave way. 

Instantly, the small hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. All that was before me was a dimly lit hallway, with plain beige carpeting and a few hotel paintings on the walls. Nothing too out of the ordinary. And yet, I had the overwhelming feeling that something was desperately wrong within the bank. I just couldn’t put my finger on it. 

I crept cautiously down the stretch, my footsteps muted and careful. “Hello? I called out again, my voice breaking the steady silence. I passed a few offices, each empty, though most of them had computer monitors fired up and displaying unopened emails and half-filled spreadsheets. 

I kept up my slow pace across each doorframe, until the contents of one room caught my attention. It was a well-decorated office, definitely one of the nicer ones in the building, with custom painted walls and little sculptures on a bookshelf. And there, on the cherry wood desk, was a candle, reduced entirely to liquid, the wick burning tall and smoking. 

I hesitantly entered the room, and, finding it once again empty, I made my way over to the unattended flame, and blew it out. 

There it was again. A bizarre feeling, a strong strangeness I couldn’t explain. And then, as the smoke curled upwards through the air, up to my nostrils, I knew what it was. 

I couldn’t smell a thing. 

Not in the way that happens when I’m sick, or when my allergies start acting up. Not a hint of the candle or its smoke was registering with my nose. In fact, the ambient smell of the bank, as soon as I stepped into this back hallway, was completely absent. I felt strange because for the first time in my entire existence, I was smelling the absolute lack of scent. 

I left the room quickly. I couldn’t help but take deep breaths, trying to pull any semblance of aroma into my lungs—but, there was nothing. I walked faster down the hallway now, my heart hammering hard in my chest. “Hello?” I called out, but again, there was no answer. 

I passed a few more offices, each uninhabited, until I reached another door, this time labeled, “**AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**.” On any other day, in any other set of circumstances, I would probably hesitate to call myself “authorized personnel” of a bank, but I was getting truly nervous that something inexplicable and terrible was going on, so I only waited a moment before I turned the handle and went inside. 

Before me was a set of stairs, dark and cold under a single fluorescent light.  A small plaque on the wall told me where the descent would lead: **THE VAULTS**. I had been around the outside of the building, the lobby, even the offices, and hadn’t found a soul. This was last place I had to search. 

The journey down was longer than I expected it to be. My footsteps echoed against the stone walls, and the air turned frigid the deeper I traveled down into the dark. As I walked, I tried a few more times to pick up any sort of scent, but it was no use. There was nothing. I considered what I would do if I didn’t find anyone down there—about how I would go about filing missing person reports for all of the bank workers, and who I would file it to, seeing as the police on the scene had disappeared as well. 

I was lost in these thoughts, when suddenly my breath hitched in my throat, and that all too familiar sensation of *wrongness* gripped my body. It only took a moment this time to figure out what had happened. 

I couldn’t hear my footsteps anymore. 

I stomped my foot down hard upon the stone just to be sure, and when no sound reverberated back to me, the chilling feeling of despair sank into my chest. What was happening to me? Two of my senses were gone, and I had no idea why. The silence was eerie, a type of quiet I had never experienced before. No whistling of my own breathing, no air conditioning in the background, nothing. 

I briefly considered going back up, leaving the depths of the bank and all of its strangeness behind—but when I peered down to the steps below me, I could see it: a light, white and fluorescent, shining in a line underneath another door. 

I ran down quickly, still taken aback by the lacking of my own footsteps as they should have clattered down the stairs. I got to the door, and there it was again, another sign that read: **AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**, but this time I hardly even gave it a second glance before I threw the door open. 

What I found inside was bizarre. 

To my right and left were the vaults, large and impressive, made of smooth steel, with security keypads and small plaques with each vault number above them.   708 was on my left, and 709 on my right—and there, halfway across the hall, right at the line between 707 and 710, I saw something I couldn’t explain. 

The best way to describe it is that things started lose their *thing-ness*. The great vaults and their polished metal, halfway down the hall, began to lose their shine and definition. Vault 707 and 710 still had the security keypads, but instead of black numbers backlit by a green light, they were just plain rectangles. The vault door, in fact, no longer stood out from the wall, but became two-dimensional part way through, as though a mural drawn upon the wall. 

I crept forward with trepidation. I passed vault 707 and 710, and reached the end of the ill-defined hall. Then, I turned the corner, and my mouth fell open into a silent scream. 

There were three vaults: 711, and 712, which were closed, and 713, which was not, though I couldn’t see inside from where I was standing. I was looking at 711 and 712 in that moment, I was sure of it, though the sight of them might suggest otherwise

The numbers on their plaques were gone, the plaques themselves reduced to flat rectangles, and the vault doors were merely crudely drawn circles against the walls. The same was for vault 713, the one that was open. And though the missing numbers could have thrown me off, I was sure this was the place where the ‘robbery’ had happened. 

I knew this, because that’s where the police officers were. 

Only, they weren’t the police officers anymore. It was as though slowly, painstakingly, every bit of definition had been pulled from their being. They stood, frozen in place at the entrances to the vaults, their hands fleshy circles, their fingers melded together. Some had eyes sunken into their faces like paper dolls, others had been smoothed over by skin. Their uniforms had melded with their flesh, all buttons and medals of honor erased. 

I tried calling to them out of instinct, though I suspected they wouldn’t be able to hear me, and I had forgotten I couldn’t hear myself. 

I turned back around, tentatively peering into vault #713, the open vault. 

The bank robbers hadn’t taken anything, and they certainly hadn’t left anything behind. 

They had stolen *everything* and left *nothing*.

The view that greeted me from within Vault #713 was like nothing I had ever seen before—it as like *a* Nothing I had ever seen before. The vault was empty. Not to say the metal shelves were robbed of their paper stacks, or there were no gold bars in the center of the floor. There was no cash, no gold, or shelves, or even a floor. Instead, a great white expanse of space stretched before me, seemingly endless. The corners to the vault were gone, indistinguishable from the blankness. There was no ceiling. It was as though reality itself had been simply washed away—erased.

I dared not stick my head in. Something instinctual deep within the pit of my belly told me that this was not the place for me, not a place for anything that wished to remain living. I hesitated, unsure of how to go on. 

For only a moment, I saw it. 

I froze in place, as a cold trickle of dread dripped down my spine. I looked around at the detail-less, faceless figures around me. None of them seemed to have even twitched, and their chests lay still and lifeless. 

And then, I saw it again. 

A flicker of movement in the corner of my eye. In any other ordinary setting, it would have been unnoticeable. But in the uncanny stillness of the bank basement, it stood out enormously. It had been to my right, and as I whipped my head around, I saw a figure standing there. 

It was a woman, but I only deduced this because of the long hair that was pulled back beneath her police officer’s cap. And I mean just one I said: long hair. Because what I assumed had once been long locks of a flaxen blond had fused together into a single cylinder, reduced to that basic shape against the rectangle of her torso and flat sphere of her head. 

Only, her head wasn’t entirely flat. 

There, on the smooth expanse of what was once her face, was half of a mouth. The other half had been reduced to flat skin, as though the whole of it was a wound only partially healed. The remaining half was moving as much as it could, each spastic manipulation of the lips tearing at the closed edge. The spittle that flew from her was tinged pink with blood. 

I couldn’t tell what the half mouth was saying at first, partly because it was half a mouth, and partly because I had only been deaf for the previous few minutes, and hadn’t learned how to read lips. 

Eventually, though, I could tell what she was saying. At first, I thought it was “help me”, and my heart sank because, of course, I had no idea how to do as she asked, and no real way to tell her how hopeless her—*our*—situation was. 

As I watched her, my pulse rocketing at full speed, and the nausea and anxiety deep in the pit of my stomach, I noticed it—her mouth was closing up. Like a cruel zipper, each time her lips came together to repeat her mantra, the skin kept closed just a little bit more. And each time they reopened, they ripped just a bit, too. 

Close, rip, close, rip, close, rip. 

I could do nothing but watch. By the end, only a tiny hole of a mouth was left, and though most of it was concealed by the thick rosy foam of saliva and blood she had been emitting, I could see what she was saying, no matter how much I wish I couldn’t. 

*Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.* 

Then, the mouth was gone, and all was still. 

Instinctively, I reached for her hand for some semblance of comfort, if not for her, then for me. It was nothing more than a fleshy cube, that was once a clenched fist. It wasn’t warm, or cold. It wasn’t anything, really. 

That was when I dropped her hand. 

Tentatively, I reached my finger up to my mouth, and popped it in. Then, I bit. Then, I bit harder. 

I brought my finger away from my mouth, and saw that it was red. My heart sank even further. Not only could I not taste the blood I had just drawn—I hadn’t been able to feel the bite. 

I stared down at my hands, completely bewildered and shocked by the lack of sensation. Then I noticed something even more terrible. 

My fingerprints. They were gone. 

My fingers were completely smooth, unblemished, as though there had never been any marks on them in the first place. 

That was when I decided it was time to leave. 

I passed by the frozen faceless police officers as I traced my steps back the way I had come, away from the three vaults that had been broken into. 

I walked quickly, but it was difficult, now that the loss of feeling had crept its way into my legs. I had to consciously keep my knees from buckling, and as I walked, the worst possibility began to turn to reality. 

The police officers at the end of the hallway were gone. Well, not gone, exactly. Though their featureless figures no longer took up room on the floor, their likeness was still present. They were flattened against the walls, like a terrible geometric mural of suffering. They blended into one another, tortured subjects all melded together in a single painting. Was that the final step to this terrible process? Become two dimensional, and then, eventually join that great white void that had already overtaken vault #713?

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. 

I traveled faster now, and saw that more of the vaults had joined the others I had seen before—their doors no longer stood out from the walls, and the plaques that displayed their numbers no longer showed any writing. Everything was sinking into the backdrop, the hallways becoming cavernous and empty. 

Then, a horrifying thought dawned on me. 

I began to run with great difficulty, my numb legs and feet meeting the floor clumsily as I rounded the final corner. Then, I saw that what I feared had already begun to come true.

There, at the end of the hallway, was the door I had entered, the one that read **AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**. Except, it didn’t say that anymore. In fact, the sign itself was blank, and the corners no longer stood out against the metal of the door. I knew what would happen next, and I lunged for the handle, and gripped it as tightly as I could with numb fingers. I turned and pulled. 

Nothing happened. 

The door didn’t budge, and it was clear why. Around the edges it had fused with the wall, the beginning signs of the same fading and conjoining that everything else beneath the bank had gone through. 

My hands shook with the effort, and with the incredible amount of fear that was coursing through my veins. I looked at them pleadingly, as though willing them to find the strength to yank the door from its hinges. 

That was when I noticed I didn’t have fingernails anymore. 

They hadn’t fallen off, or been ripped or anything. There were no wounds. It was as though they had simply sunk into my skin, like a twin reabsorbed in the womb. 

I gripped the handle again.

I braced my sensationless feet against either side of the doorframe. 

I pulled with a tremendous amount of effort, unable to hear the panting sound of my breath, unable to smell the stench of sweat and fear that radiated off of my skin, unable, even, to feel my own heart beating in my chest. 

And then, like the police officer’s mouth had torn her skin, the door peeled away from the wall. 

The journey up the stairs would have been painful, had I been able to feel a thing. I fell a few times, once from nerves, and the others from the stair flattening itself below my feet. On the last fall, my face slammed against the metal ground, and I saw red drip onto my shirt, though I couldn’t tell if it was from my nose or my head. 

Then, there it was, the letters gone but still recognizable. The door at the top of the stairs. 

I burst through it, and spilled into the hallway that housed the bank offices, only this time, they seemed different. The hotel paintings on the walls were blank, just thin rectangles upon plain wallpaper. The scenes I had passed on the way in of the view of each office through the open doorframes were now just that—scenes. They were flattened into pictures against the wall, the rooms completely inaccessible. 

I ran still further, turning another corner, and then I could see it: **EMPLOYEES ONLY**. 

There, a door that still had its sign, my salvation. 

I read the words as I stumbled towards the door, and then I blinked. 

My left eye came open, but my right did not. It was stuck, as though with glue, the top lid to the bottom. And I knew from what I had seen of the police officers in the vault room, that this was absolutely something to be afraid of. 

So, I ran. 

I spilled out onto the cold marble bank floor. That was the first thing I noticed—the floor was cold. I could feel cold again. I could taste the blood in my mouth, the ache in my legs—I could feel the immense pain of having to rip my eyelids back apart where they had fused. 

And, of course, I could see it, flattened against the wall. The door that read **EMPLOYEES ONLY**, the handle of which was now merely a picture, forever out of reach.
